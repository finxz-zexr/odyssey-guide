# Book 16: Father and Son

## Summary

Book 16 marks the pivotal moment when Odysseus reveals his true identity to his son Telemachus. The book begins with Telemachus arriving at Eumaeus's hut. The swineherd greets him joyfully, like a father welcoming a son returned from a distant land. Odysseus, still disguised as a beggar, respectfully rises to offer his seat, but Telemachus insists he remain seated.

Telemachus inquires about the stranger and discusses the situation at the palace with Eumaeus. Learning that his mother Penelope still holds out against the suitors, Telemachus sends Eumaeus to inform Penelope of his safe return, ensuring that only she receives the news to prevent the suitors from learning of it too quickly.

Once they are alone, Athena appears to Odysseus (invisible to Telemachus) and signals that it is time to reveal himself to his son. She transforms Odysseus back to his true appearance—tall, strong, and regal. Telemachus, astonished by the sudden transformation, initially believes he is seeing a god and backs away in fear. Odysseus identifies himself as his father, explaining that Athena has the power to change his appearance at will.

After an emotional reunion with tears and embraces, father and son begin plotting their revenge against the suitors. Odysseus learns that there are 108 suitors in total, and they discuss whether they can defeat such a large number with only two men. Odysseus assures Telemachus that with Athena and Zeus on their side, they will prevail. They agree on a plan: Odysseus will return to the palace still disguised as a beggar, enduring any abuse from the suitors, while Telemachus must remove all weapons from the great hall and remain calm no matter how the suitors or Odysseus himself are treated.

Meanwhile, the suitors' ship returns to Ithaca after failing to ambush Telemachus. The suitors, learning of Telemachus's safe return, discuss a new plot to kill him. Amphinomus advises caution, suggesting they first seek divine approval, but his counsel is ignored. When Penelope confronts the suitors about their murderous plot against her son, Eurymachus brazenly lies to her face, denying any such plan while secretly maintaining his deadly intentions.

The book ends with Eumaeus returning to his hut, where Odysseus has resumed his beggar disguise, setting the stage for their journey to the palace the next day.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 16 as a philosophical exploration of the theme of recognition (anagnorisis) and its relationship to identity and political order. The reunion between Odysseus and Telemachus represents what Benardete sees as a crucial moment in the restoration of legitimate authority in Ithaca.

Benardete pays particular attention to the manner of Odysseus's self-revelation to Telemachus. Unlike the emotional recognition scenes that will come later with Penelope and Laertes, this revelation is direct and strategic. Odysseus reveals himself to his son not primarily for emotional closure but to enlist him as an ally in the coming battle. This approach represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical priority of political restoration over personal reunion in Odysseus's return.

The initial mistaking of Odysseus for a god by Telemachus represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of the relationship between the human and divine that runs throughout the epic. Odysseus's response—"No, I am not a god... I am your father"—establishes what Benardete interprets as a crucial distinction between divine appearance and human reality. This distinction illustrates the philosophical insight that legitimate political authority, while it may have divine sanction, must be embodied in human relationships.

The detailed planning of the revenge against the suitors represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of metis (cunning intelligence) as the foundation of political action. Odysseus does not rely on force alone but on a careful strategy that takes into account the specific circumstances of the situation. This approach illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical ideal of practical wisdom that combines moral purpose with effective means.

The contrast between Odysseus's truthful revelation to his son and Eurymachus's deceitful denial to Penelope represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between truth and political order. While the suitors maintain their power through lies, Odysseus begins to restore legitimate rule by establishing a community of truth with his son. This contrast illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical connection between truthfulness and justice in political life.

## Notable Passages

> "No, I am not a god. Why do you compare me to the immortals? I am your father, the same man for whom you have grieved and suffered so much, the victim of men's aggression."

Odysseus's response to Telemachus's mistaking him for a god represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of the human embodiment of authority. This statement illustrates the insight that legitimate rule must be recognized as human rather than divine, even while it may have divine support.

> "No man has ever laid eyes on the goddess when she appears in all her power. Only to you, to me, to our serving-women and our dogs—to us alone she shows herself. The others cannot see her."

This explanation of Athena's selective visibility represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of the limited accessibility of divine wisdom. Only those who are aligned with the restoration of proper order can perceive the divine support for that restoration, illustrating the philosophical connection between moral alignment and intellectual insight.

> "Father, I've always heard about your fame, your skill with weapons and the tricks of war. But what you're saying now, it's staggering—I'm shocked. How could two men alone go up against so many brave fighters?"

Telemachus's doubt about their ability to defeat the suitors represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical tension between conventional understanding and the exceptional insight that comes from divine wisdom. This tension illustrates the philosophical theme of the gap between ordinary human calculation and the higher understanding that guides Odysseus's actions.
