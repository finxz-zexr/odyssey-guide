# Book 17: Stranger at the Gates

## Summary

Book 17 follows Odysseus's return to his palace in disguise. The day begins with Telemachus departing from Eumaeus's hut for the city, instructing the swineherd to bring the disguised beggar (Odysseus) to the palace later. Telemachus is warmly welcomed home by his household, especially by Eurycleia, his old nurse, and by his mother Penelope, who eagerly asks for news from Sparta.

Meanwhile, the prophet Theoclymenus, who had accompanied Telemachus to Ithaca, interprets an omen—a hawk tearing a dove—as signifying that Telemachus's family will remain in power in Ithaca. Telemachus, however, is cautious about revealing everything he has learned, particularly about his father's return.

Later, Eumaeus and the disguised Odysseus set out for the city. On the way, they encounter Melanthius, a goatherd loyal to the suitors, who insults and physically abuses Odysseus. When they reach the palace, Odysseus's ancient dog Argos, now neglected and lying on a dung heap, recognizes his master after twenty years. The dog wags his tail and drops his ears but lacks the strength to approach Odysseus. After this moment of recognition, Argos dies, having lived just long enough to see his master's return.

Eumaeus enters the palace first, joining Telemachus, while Odysseus follows later as a humble beggar. The suitors, prompted by Telemachus, reluctantly provide Odysseus with food. Antinous, the most arrogant of the suitors, objects to the beggar's presence and refuses to give him anything. When Odysseus responds with a story about his former prosperity and generosity to beggars, Antinous becomes enraged and hurls a footstool at him, striking him on the shoulder.

This act of violence against a suppliant shocks even the other suitors, who fear divine retribution for such a breach of hospitality. Penelope, hearing of the incident, expresses a desire to meet the stranger and learn if he has news of Odysseus. She sends Eumaeus with this message, but Odysseus, still maintaining his disguise, suggests meeting her in the evening when the suitors are gone, to avoid further trouble.

The book ends with Eumaeus returning to his hut, leaving Odysseus in the palace surrounded by the suitors, setting the stage for further confrontations.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 17 as a philosophical exploration of the theme of recognition and its relationship to justice. The various encounters in this book—with Melanthius, Argos, and the suitors—represent what Benardete sees as different aspects of the moral and political disorder that has overtaken Ithaca in Odysseus's absence.

Benardete pays particular attention to the encounter with Argos, interpreting it as a philosophical reflection on the nature of recognition that transcends human speech. Unlike the humans who fail to recognize Odysseus beneath his disguise, Argos immediately knows his master despite twenty years of separation and Odysseus's transformed appearance. This recognition represents what Benardete identifies as a natural bond that exists beyond conventional social relationships, illustrating the philosophical theme of nature (physis) versus convention (nomos) that runs throughout the epic.

The contrast between Melanthius's abuse and Eumaeus's loyalty represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical problem of the proper relationship between masters and servants in a political community. While Melanthius has aligned himself with the illegitimate power of the suitors, Eumaeus maintains his loyalty to the legitimate ruler even when that ruler appears to be absent. This contrast illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical distinction between self-interest and justice as motivations for political allegiance.

Antinous's violence toward the disguised Odysseus represents what Benardete interprets as the ultimate corruption of the guest-host relationship (xenia) that forms the moral foundation of Greek society. By attacking a suppliant, Antinous violates what Benardete sees as the most basic principle of justice in the Homeric world. The other suitors' fear of divine retribution for this act illustrates what Benardete identifies as the theological dimension of justice—the belief that the gods ultimately punish violations of moral order.

Penelope's desire to meet with the stranger represents what Benardete sees as her intuitive connection to her husband despite his disguise. While she does not consciously recognize Odysseus, her interest in the beggar suggests what Benardete interprets as a deeper form of recognition that operates below the level of conscious awareness. This intuitive connection illustrates the philosophical theme of the relationship between knowledge and identity that runs throughout the epic.

## Notable Passages

> "As soon as he caught sight of Odysseus standing there, he wagged his tail and dropped both ears, but lacked the strength to drag himself any closer to his master."

The description of Argos's recognition of Odysseus represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of natural knowledge that transcends appearance. This moment illustrates the insight that some forms of recognition operate at a level more fundamental than social convention or physical appearance.

> "The gods themselves, disguised as strangers from abroad, assume all sorts of shapes and visit cities, watching over people's violence and their lawful ways."

This statement about divine oversight of human justice represents what Benardete sees as the theological foundation of moral order in the Homeric world. The possibility that strangers might be gods in disguise creates what Benardete identifies as a philosophical imperative to treat all guests with respect, illustrating the connection between theology and ethics.

> "That's the most shameful act I've witnessed here. Some god must be inside our walls. That was no mortal man—that was a god, I tell you, wrapped in human form, visiting our city's noble houses."

The suitors' fear after Antinous strikes Odysseus represents what Benardete interprets as the philosophical insight that violations of justice provoke divine retribution. This fear illustrates what Benardete sees as the implicit theology of the Odyssey, in which the gods ultimately ensure that justice prevails despite temporary disorder.
