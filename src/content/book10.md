# Book 10: The Bewitching Queen of Aeaea

## Summary

Book 10 continues Odysseus's narrative of his journey home from Troy. After escaping the Cyclops, Odysseus and his crew reach the island of Aeolia, home of Aeolus, keeper of the winds. Aeolus welcomes them for a month and, upon their departure, gives Odysseus a sealed bag containing all the adverse winds to ensure a safe voyage home. For nine days, Odysseus personally steers the ship without rest. On the tenth day, with Ithaca in sight, he finally falls asleep. His curious crew, suspecting the bag contains treasure, open it, releasing the winds that blow them far off course back to Aeolia. Aeolus, believing Odysseus is cursed by the gods, refuses to help them again.

They next reach the land of the Laestrygonians, a race of giant cannibals who destroy all but Odysseus's own ship by hurling boulders at the fleet and spearing the men like fish. Odysseus and his surviving crew escape to the island of Aeaea, home of the enchantress Circe. Odysseus divides his men into two groups led by himself and Eurylochus. When Eurylochus's group investigates Circe's house, she transforms them into swine with a magic potion and her wand.

Eurylochus escapes to warn Odysseus, who then sets out alone to rescue his men. On the way, he meets Hermes, who gives him a magical herb called moly to protect him from Circe's magic and advises him on how to overcome her. When Circe's potion fails to transform Odysseus, she recognizes that he must be Odysseus, whom Hermes had prophesied would come. Odysseus forces her to swear an oath not to harm him and to restore his men, which she does.

Circe invites them to stay, and they remain on her island for a year, feasting and recovering. Eventually, Odysseus's men urge him to continue their journey home. Circe tells Odysseus he must first journey to the Underworld to consult the spirit of the prophet Tiresias. She provides detailed instructions for reaching the land of the dead and performing the necessary rituals. The book ends with the death of Elpenor, the youngest crew member, who falls from Circe's roof while drunk and breaks his neck.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 10 as a philosophical exploration of the relationship between human nature, animality, and divinity. The transformations in this book—men becoming animals under Circe's spell, and Odysseus temporarily rising above ordinary humanity through divine aid—raise fundamental questions about what it means to be human.

Benardete pays particular attention to the contrast between Odysseus and his men. The crew's inability to resist opening the bag of winds represents what Benardete sees as a failure of self-restraint that characterizes ordinary humanity. Odysseus, in contrast, demonstrates extraordinary endurance by steering without sleep for nine days. This contrast establishes what Benardete calls the "philosophical anthropology" of the Odyssey—its implicit theory of human nature and its limitations.

The encounter with Circe represents what Benardete identifies as a crucial philosophical moment in the epic. Circe's transformation of men into swine literalizes what Benardete sees as the bestial potential within human nature. The men retain their human minds while inhabiting animal bodies—a state that Benardete interprets as representing the condition of desire without reason's control.

Odysseus's immunity to Circe's magic through the divine herb moly represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical ideal of maintaining human rationality against the pull of animal desire. The herb, given by Hermes, symbolizes divine wisdom that allows Odysseus to engage with Circe without being transformed. This interaction between the divine (Hermes), the human (Odysseus), and the natural (the herb) illustrates what Benardete identifies as the complex interplay between different orders of being in Homer's philosophical cosmos.

Circe's eventual transformation from threat to helper represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of the domestication of natural forces through human intelligence. By compelling Circe to swear an oath, Odysseus brings her into the human moral order governed by promises and obligations. This transformation parallels what Benardete identifies as the broader philosophical movement of the Odyssey from nature to convention, from physis to nomos.

## Notable Passages

> "They were men again, younger than they were before, more handsome, taller by far."

This description of the restored crew members illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical significance of transformation in the Odyssey—the possibility of becoming more fully human through the experience of temporarily losing one's humanity.

> "Here, take this herb and enter Circe's halls. Its power will save you from the fatal day."

Hermes's gift of the moly herb represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of divine wisdom protecting human rationality against the forces that would reduce humans to beasts.

> "Come, sheathe your sword, let's go to bed together, mount my bed and mix in the magic work of love—we'll breed deep trust between us."

Circe's invitation to Odysseus represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical challenge of engaging with powerful natural forces without being overwhelmed by them—a challenge that Odysseus meets through a combination of divine aid, human cunning, and moral restraint.
