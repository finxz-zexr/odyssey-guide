# Book 15: The Prince Sets Sail for Home

## Summary

Book 15 follows two parallel storylines: Telemachus's journey back to Ithaca from Sparta and Odysseus's continued stay with Eumaeus the swineherd. The book begins with Athena visiting Telemachus in Sparta, urging him to return home immediately to avoid the suitors' ambush and warning him about certain suitors' plans to kill him before he reaches home.

After bidding farewell to Menelaus and Helen, who give him parting gifts, Telemachus sets sail with Pisistratus. They stop briefly at Pylos, but Telemachus avoids visiting Nestor to save time. There, he takes aboard a prophet named Theoclymenus, who is fleeing blood guilt after killing a man. As Telemachus sails for Ithaca, the narrative shifts back to Odysseus and Eumaeus.

Still disguised as a beggar, Odysseus tests Eumaeus by suggesting he might leave the next day to seek employment among the suitors. Eumaeus strongly advises against this, describing the suitors' arrogance and violence. Odysseus then asks about his parents, learning that his mother Anticlea died of grief and his father Laertes lives in squalor, mourning both his son and his wife.

Eumaeus then tells his own life story: he was born a prince on the island of Syrie but was kidnapped as a child by Phoenician traders with the help of his nurse. Sold into slavery, he was purchased by Laertes and raised alongside Odysseus's sister Ctimene.

The narrative returns to Telemachus, who safely reaches Ithaca, avoiding the suitors' ambush. Following Athena's instructions, he sends his crew ahead to the city while he visits Eumaeus first. The book ends with Telemachus's ship arriving in the harbor and a herald announcing its safe return to Penelope, while the suitors, whose ambush has failed, plot their next move.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 15 as a philosophical exploration of the theme of homecoming (nostos) and its relationship to identity and recognition. The parallel journeys of father and son—Odysseus's metaphorical journey back to his identity and Telemachus's physical journey back to Ithaca—represent what Benardete sees as two aspects of the philosophical problem of return.

Benardete pays particular attention to the various life stories shared in this book, especially Eumaeus's tale of his noble birth and subsequent enslavement. This narrative represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of the reversibility of fortune that runs throughout the epic. Eumaeus's story mirrors Odysseus's own reversal from king to beggar, illustrating the philosophical insight that identity transcends external circumstances.

The gifts Telemachus receives from Menelaus and Helen represent what Benardete sees as the philosophical importance of material objects as bearers of memory and relationship. Helen's gift of a wedding robe for Telemachus's future bride creates what Benardete calls a "thread of continuity" between generations, symbolizing the transmission of cultural memory that sustains a community across time.

Theoclymenus's status as a prophet and fugitive introduces what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of divine knowledge and its relationship to human justice. As a seer who can interpret omens, Theoclymenus represents a form of wisdom that transcends ordinary human understanding, yet he is simultaneously subject to human law as a fugitive from blood guilt. This dual status illustrates what Benardete sees as the complex interplay between divine and human orders in the Homeric world.

The failed ambush of the suitors represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the limitations of human planning when it opposes divine purpose. Despite their careful preparations, the suitors cannot prevent Telemachus's return because Athena has ordained otherwise. This failure illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of the ultimate governance of human affairs by divine intelligence that runs throughout the epic.

## Notable Passages

> "So, you're keen to sail back to your own native land? Good luck to you, even so... if you only knew, down deep, what pains are fated to fill your cup before you reach that shore, you'd stay right here..."

Helen's words to Telemachus represent what Benardete identifies as the philosophical tension between the desire for homecoming and the dangers it entails. This tension illustrates the complex nature of nostos as both a goal to be achieved and a process that involves suffering.

> "But now, with all my heart I long to go back to my own native land. My spirit's chafed within me all these days—if any comrade's willing to host a guest, the guest can hardly wait to leave his house."

Odysseus's words (still in disguise) represent what Benardete sees as the philosophical primacy of the desire for home over all other considerations. This desire illustrates what Benardete identifies as the natural attachment to one's own place that forms the basis of political community.

> "The day you were torn from your parents and your homeland, Zeus with his far-seeing eyes looked down on you in kindness even then."

Odysseus's response to Eumaeus's life story represents what Benardete interprets as the philosophical theme of divine providence operating even through apparent misfortune. This perspective illustrates what Benardete sees as the complex theological vision of the Odyssey, in which suffering can be part of a larger divine plan.
