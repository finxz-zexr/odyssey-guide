# Book 1: Athena Inspires the Prince

## Summary

Book 1 of Homer's Odyssey introduces the central conflict and sets the stage for the epic. It begins with an invocation to the Muse, asking her to tell the story of Odysseus, the man of twists and turns. The scene then shifts to Mount Olympus, where the gods are discussing the fate of Odysseus, who has been held captive on the island of Ogygia by the nymph Calypso for seven years. Athena, goddess of wisdom and Odysseus's patron, pleads with her father Zeus to allow Odysseus to return home to Ithaca.

Meanwhile in Ithaca, Odysseus's palace has been overrun by suitors seeking to marry his wife Penelope, believing Odysseus to be dead. These suitors feast daily on Odysseus's provisions, depleting his wealth. Odysseus's son Telemachus, now a young man, feels powerless to stop them.

Athena, disguised as Mentes, a family friend, visits Telemachus. She encourages him to stand up to the suitors and to journey to Pylos and Sparta to seek news of his father. Athena's intervention marks the beginning of Telemachus's transformation from a passive youth to a more assertive young man ready to take action. The book ends with Telemachus announcing to the suitors his intention to hold an assembly the next day.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete identifies Book 1 as the beginning of a philosophical exploration of political rule and natural right. Unlike the Iliad, which begins with names (Achilles and his father), the Odyssey begins with a man defined by his anonymity coupled with knowledge—"a much-traveled man separated from father and fatherland."

Benardete sees this opening as significant because it establishes the central tension of the epic: Odysseus must return to rule Ithaca, but his journey has transformed him. Before his voyage, Odysseus ruled by natural right but had not used his mind to understand natural right. His return will require "the conscious effort to put power and wisdom together."

The intervention of Athena represents the role of mind (nous) in political affairs. Benardete notes that "the Odyssey is remarkable for the light touch with which Athena guides the course of events," suggesting that for the ancients, there is no tight connection between the rule of reason and the violent course of human events.

The situation in Ithaca—with the suitors consuming Odysseus's wealth—represents a crisis of succession in a natural right monarchy. Telemachus's education under Athena's guidance is the beginning of his preparation to potentially rule, though his imprudent behavior (blurting out Athena's private advice in front of the suitors) puts his own natural right to rule into question.

## Notable Passages

> "Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns
> driven time and again off course, once he had plundered
> the hallowed heights of Troy.
> Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds,
> many pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea,
> fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home."

This opening invocation establishes the central character as defined by his intelligence, suffering, and determination—qualities that will be philosophically examined throughout the epic.

> "My mother says I am his son; I know not surely.
> Who has known his own engendering? I wish at least
> I had some happy man as father, growing old in his own house—
> but unknown is the lineage of him whom they call my father."

Telemachus's uncertainty about his paternity reflects the theme of natural right versus paternity in political rule. His statement questions the basis of legitimate rule and succession.

> "You'll soon see for yourself if you've a prophet's blood in your veins."

Athena's challenge to Telemachus represents the beginning of his education and the question of whether he has inherited his father's qualities of mind and courage—essential for rule by natural right rather than mere paternity.
