# Book 11: The Kingdom of the Dead

## Summary

Book 11, often called "The Nekuia" (a ritual for summoning the dead), follows Odysseus's journey to the Underworld. Following Circe's instructions, Odysseus and his crew sail to the edge of the Ocean stream, where they perform sacrifices to summon the spirits of the dead. Odysseus digs a pit, pours libations, and sacrifices animals, allowing the blood to flow into the pit to attract the spirits.

The first ghost to appear is Elpenor, Odysseus's crew member who died on Circe's island. He begs Odysseus to return to Aeaea and give his body proper burial rites. Next comes Tiresias, the blind prophet, who drinks the sacrificial blood and delivers his prophecy: Odysseus will return home, but only after many trials. He warns Odysseus not to harm the cattle of Helios on Thrinacia, predicts that he will kill the suitors upon his return, and foretells that Odysseus must later make a journey inland carrying an oar until he reaches people who know nothing of the sea.

After Tiresias departs, Odysseus's mother Anticlea approaches. She tells him that she died of grief waiting for his return and updates him on his family: his father Laertes lives in squalor, mourning his absence; Penelope remains faithful but grief-stricken; and Telemachus manages the estate.

Odysseus then encounters a parade of famous women from mythology, including Tyro, Antiope, Alcmene, Epicaste, Chloris, Leda, Iphimedeia, Phaedra, Procris, Ariadne, Maera, Clymene, and Eriphyle. After this, Odysseus pauses in his narration to the Phaeacians, who are spellbound by his tale.

When urged to continue, Odysseus describes meeting the spirits of his comrades from the Trojan War: Agamemnon, who recounts his murder by his wife Clytemnestra and warns Odysseus to be wary upon his return home; Achilles, who laments that he would rather be a living slave than king of the dead; and Ajax, who still refuses to speak to Odysseus due to their quarrel over Achilles's armor.

Finally, Odysseus describes seeing other famous dead: Minos judging the dead, Orion hunting, Tityus suffering eternal punishment, Tantalus eternally tantalized by unreachable food and water, Sisyphus endlessly pushing his boulder uphill, and the shade of Heracles (though the real Heracles is among the gods on Olympus). Overwhelmed by the gathering throng of spirits and fearing he might see the Gorgon's head, Odysseus returns to his ship, and they sail away from the land of the dead.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 11 as central to the philosophical dimension of the Odyssey. The journey to the Underworld represents what Benardete calls a "second sailing"—a philosophical quest for knowledge that goes beyond ordinary experience.

Benardete pays particular attention to the structure of the Nekuia, noting that it moves from the recently dead (Elpenor) to the ancient dead (the mythological figures), creating a kind of historical perspective that allows Odysseus to situate his own journey within a broader context of human experience. This movement through time represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical quest to understand the human condition across different eras and circumstances.

The encounter with Tiresias is especially significant in Benardete's reading. The prophet's ability to retain his mind even in death represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical ideal of wisdom that transcends the limitations of bodily existence. Tiresias's prophecy about Odysseus's future journey inland carrying an oar symbolizes what Benardete interprets as the movement from the maritime world of adventure and uncertainty to the inland world of stability and agriculture—a philosophical journey from chaos to order.

The parade of famous women represents what Benardete sees as a philosophical reflection on the role of eros (desire) in human life. These women, many of whom were loved by gods, embody the complex interplay between divine and human desire that shapes human history. Their stories collectively illustrate what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of the power and danger of eros in both divine and human realms.

The encounters with Agamemnon, Achilles, and Ajax represent what Benardete calls a philosophical examination of different models of heroism. Agamemnon's warning about the dangers of homecoming reflects the political dimension of return; Achilles's lament about preferring life to glorious death represents a reversal of the heroic values of the Iliad; and Ajax's silent resentment illustrates the limitations of the heroic code in addressing complex ethical questions.

## Notable Passages

> "Better, I say, to break sod as a farm hand for some poor country man, on iron rations, than lord it over all the exhausted dead."

Achilles's statement represents what Benardete sees as a philosophical reassessment of the heroic values celebrated in the Iliad. This reversal suggests a more complex understanding of the relationship between glory and happiness, between seeming and being.

> "As I told you, you will reach your home, but you will find trouble there. Arrogant men consume your livelihood, court your noble wife, and offer gifts to win her."

Tiresias's prophecy illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of the return to political reality after the fantastical adventures. The prophecy connects Odysseus's supernatural journey to the human world of political conflict that awaits him in Ithaca.

> "Mother, why do you evade me when I try to embrace you? Even in Hades's halls, can we not throw our loving arms around each other and share cold comfort in our tears?"

Odysseus's attempt to embrace his mother's shade represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical exploration of the limits of human connection across the boundary of death. This moment illustrates the tension between love and knowledge, between emotional desire and philosophical understanding.
