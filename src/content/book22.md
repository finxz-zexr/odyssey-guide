# Book 22: Slaughter in the Hall

## Summary

Book 22 depicts the violent climax of the Odyssey as Odysseus finally takes his revenge on the suitors. The book begins immediately after Odysseus has strung the bow and shot an arrow through the twelve axes. Still in his beggar's rags but now revealing his true identity, Odysseus turns his aim toward Antinous, the most arrogant of the suitors, and shoots an arrow through his throat while he is drinking from a cup. As Antinous falls dead, the other suitors are initially confused, thinking the shot was an accident.

Odysseus then openly declares himself, announcing that judgment has come for the suitors who have devoured his wealth, pursued his wife, and plotted against his son. The suitors panic as they realize their weapons have been removed from the hall. Eurymachus attempts to negotiate, offering compensation for all they have consumed, but Odysseus rejects this offer, declaring that nothing short of their blood will satisfy his vengeance.

Eurymachus then tries to rally the suitors to fight, but Odysseus kills him with another arrow. Telemachus, armed with a spear, kills Amphinomus and then runs to a storeroom to fetch shields, spears, and helmets for his father, himself, and the two loyal servants, Eumaeus and Philoetius. Unfortunately, he accidentally leaves the storeroom door unlocked, allowing the goatherd Melanthius to sneak in and arm some of the suitors.

The battle rages in the hall, with Odysseus and his small band fighting against the numerous suitors. Athena appears in the form of Mentor to encourage Odysseus, though she does not immediately intervene in the fighting, wanting to test Odysseus's and Telemachus's valor. Melanthius makes a second trip to the storeroom for weapons, but this time Eumaeus and Philoetius catch him and string him up from the rafters.

As the fighting continues, Athena finally displays her aegis (shield) from the roof beams, causing panic among the suitors. Odysseus and his allies systematically kill all the suitors, showing no mercy despite their pleas. Only the herald Medon and the bard Phemius are spared, as they had been forced to serve the suitors against their will.

After all the suitors are dead, Odysseus orders the disloyal maidservants—those who had slept with the suitors—to clean the hall and remove the bodies. Then, on Telemachus's suggestion, these twelve women are executed by hanging. Melanthius is also brutally executed for his treachery.

The book ends with Odysseus purifying the hall with sulfur and fire, cleansing it of the bloodshed, while the loyal servants rejoice in their master's return and the restoration of justice to the household.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 22 as a philosophical exploration of the theme of justice and its relationship to violence. The slaughter of the suitors represents what Benardete sees as the necessary restoration of political order through the elimination of those who have violated its fundamental principles.

Benardete pays particular attention to the transformation of Odysseus from disguised beggar to revealed king. This transformation represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of the relationship between appearance and reality in political authority. By casting off his disguise and revealing himself as the rightful king, Odysseus illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical insight that legitimate rule ultimately requires open declaration rather than continued concealment.

The rejection of Eurymachus's offer of compensation represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the limits of economic justice. The suitors' attempt to reduce their offense to a matter of material consumption that can be repaid with goods illustrates what Benardete sees as the inadequacy of purely economic thinking about justice. Odysseus's insistence on blood vengeance represents the philosophical insight that some violations of political order cannot be remedied through material compensation alone.

Athena's delayed intervention represents what Benardete identifies as a philosophical meditation on the relationship between divine and human agency in the establishment of justice. By initially holding back to test Odysseus's and Telemachus's valor, Athena illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical principle that divine support for justice requires human initiative and courage. This balance between human and divine action symbolizes what Benardete interprets as the theological dimension of political restoration in the Homeric world.

The purification of the hall with sulfur and fire represents what Benardete sees as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between violence and purification in the restoration of order. This ritual cleansing illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical insight that the violence necessary for justice must itself be purified to prevent the cycle of vengeance from continuing indefinitely. The purification symbolizes the transition from the disorder of the suitors' occupation to the restored order of Odysseus's rule.

## Notable Passages

> "You dogs! You never thought I'd return from Troy—so you squandered my house, you ravished my serving-women, you courted my wife while I was still alive—with no fear of the gods who rule the skies above, no fear of men's revenge in years to come. Now death's cords bind you all!"

Odysseus's declaration to the suitors represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of justice as the restoration of proper relationships. This statement illustrates the multiple dimensions of the suitors' transgression—against divine law, human custom, and Odysseus's personal rights—that justify their punishment.

> "No winning words, Eurymachus, not if you paid me back all your father's wealth, all you possess, and more besides. My hands will never rest from killing until all you suitors have paid for your crimes."

Odysseus's rejection of compensation represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical insight that justice sometimes requires punishment rather than restitution. This response illustrates the philosophical theme of the limits of economic thinking about moral and political wrongs.

> "Mentor, don't let his words mislead you! Don't help him—or you'll suffer, too, when we've killed these two. Once we've spilled their blood, you'll die with them—that scheme you're hatching—we'll confiscate your lands, all that you possess, we'll throw your sons and daughters out of your house, we'll never let your wife and children live in town!"

The suitors' threat to Mentor (actually Athena) represents what Benardete interprets as the philosophical theme of the contagious nature of political disorder. This threat illustrates what Benardete sees as the insight that injustice, if unchecked, tends to spread beyond its initial boundaries, eventually corrupting the entire political community.
