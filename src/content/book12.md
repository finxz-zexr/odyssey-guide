# Book 12: The Cattle of the Sun

## Summary

Book 12 continues Odysseus's narrative to the Phaeacians, describing the final leg of his journey before reaching Calypso's island. After returning from the Underworld to Aeaea, Odysseus and his crew give Elpenor a proper burial as promised. Circe then provides Odysseus with detailed warnings and instructions for the dangerous journey ahead.

First, she warns about the Sirens, whose enchanting songs lure sailors to their deaths. Following Circe's advice, Odysseus plugs his men's ears with beeswax but has himself tied to the mast so he can hear the Sirens' song without endangering the ship. The strategy works, and they safely navigate past the Sirens.

Next, they must choose between two perilous routes: either through the Wandering Rocks, which destroy all ships, or through a narrow strait guarded by two monsters—Scylla, a six-headed creature that devours sailors, and Charybdis, a whirlpool that threatens to sink entire ships. Odysseus chooses the strait, reasoning that losing six men to Scylla is better than losing the entire ship to Charybdis. As they pass through, Scylla snatches and devours six of Odysseus's best men, a horrifying sight that Odysseus describes as the most pitiful he witnessed in all his travels.

Finally, they reach the island of Thrinacia, home to the sacred cattle of the sun god Helios. Despite Tiresias's and Circe's explicit warnings to avoid harming these cattle, Odysseus's crew insists on landing. Odysseus makes them swear an oath not to touch the cattle, but when adverse winds trap them on the island for a month and their provisions run out, the crew, led by Eurylochus, slaughters some cattle while Odysseus is asleep.

When they set sail again, Zeus fulfills Helios's demand for vengeance by sending a terrible storm that destroys the ship and drowns all the crew except Odysseus. Clinging to the wreckage, Odysseus drifts back to Charybdis, narrowly escapes being sucked into the whirlpool, and eventually reaches Calypso's island, where he remains for seven years until the events at the beginning of the epic. With this, Odysseus concludes his tale to the Phaeacians.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 12 as a philosophical exploration of the limits of human wisdom and self-control. The various trials Odysseus faces represent different challenges to rational governance—both of oneself and of others.

Benardete pays particular attention to the episode of the Sirens, interpreting it as a philosophical allegory about the relationship between knowledge and restraint. The Sirens promise Odysseus knowledge of "all that comes to pass on the fertile earth," a temptation that appeals directly to his intellectual curiosity. Odysseus's strategy—having himself bound while allowing himself to hear the song—represents what Benardete sees as a philosophical insight into the necessary constraints on the pursuit of knowledge. Unlike his men, who are protected through ignorance (their plugged ears), Odysseus experiences the temptation but is physically restrained from yielding to it. This arrangement symbolizes what Benardete identifies as the philosophical ideal of experiencing desire while maintaining rational control over one's actions.

The choice between Scylla and Charybdis represents what Benardete calls a philosophical reflection on the nature of political decision-making. Odysseus must choose between certain but limited harm (six men taken by Scylla) and the risk of total destruction (the entire ship sucked down by Charybdis). His decision to sacrifice six men rather than risk all illustrates what Benardete sees as the tragic dimension of political leadership—the necessity of choosing between imperfect alternatives and bearing responsibility for the consequences.

The episode of the cattle of the sun represents what Benardete identifies as a philosophical examination of the relationship between divine prohibition and human transgression. Despite multiple explicit warnings, the crew's hunger leads them to violate the taboo against harming the sacred cattle. Benardete interprets this as illustrating the philosophical problem of akrasia—weakness of will or acting against one's better judgment. The crew knows they should not touch the cattle, yet their immediate physical needs override this knowledge.

Odysseus's survival as the sole member of his crew represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of the exceptional individual who, through a combination of divine favor and personal excellence, transcends the limitations that constrain ordinary humanity. Yet Benardete also notes the cost of this exceptionalism—Odysseus's isolation and the loss of all his companions.

## Notable Passages

> "Come closer, famous Odysseus, Achaea's pride and glory, moor your ship on our coast so you can hear our song! Never has any sailor passed our shores in his black craft until he has heard the honeyed voices pouring from our lips, and once he hears to his heart's content sails on, a wiser man."

The Sirens' song represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical temptation of unlimited knowledge—a temptation that must be resisted not through ignorance but through self-restraint.

> "No crying out for help, no sudden panic—Scylla's there and nothing can save you from her now. Better by far to lose six men and keep your ship than lose your entire crew."

Odysseus's decision illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical dimension of political leadership—the necessity of making tragic choices and accepting their consequences.

> "Not for the world, not if I had known what pain would come of it, would I have let my men lay hands on the cattle of the sun."

This retrospective lament illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical problem of foreknowledge and responsibility—the gap between knowing something in principle and fully understanding its consequences in practice.
