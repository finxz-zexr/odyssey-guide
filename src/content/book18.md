# Book 18: The Beggar-King of Ithaca

## Summary

Book 18 continues Odysseus's time in his palace disguised as a beggar. The book begins with the arrival of a real beggar named Irus, who regularly begs from the suitors. Irus tries to drive Odysseus away, claiming exclusive rights to beg at the palace. When Odysseus refuses to leave, Irus threatens him with physical violence.

The suitors, amused by the prospect of a fight between beggars, encourage the confrontation and offer a prize of goat sausage to the winner. Despite Odysseus's attempts to avoid the fight, warning Irus that he is stronger than he appears, the local beggar persists in his threats. When the fight begins, Odysseus debates whether to hit Irus hard enough to kill him but decides on a moderate blow that merely breaks his jaw. Irus collapses, and the suitors are impressed by the disguised Odysseus's strength.

After the fight, Amphinomus, one of the more decent suitors, offers Odysseus food and drink. In return, Odysseus warns him to leave the palace, cryptically hinting at the coming slaughter. Though troubled by this warning, Amphinomus remains, bound by fate to die with the other suitors.

Meanwhile, Athena inspires Penelope to appear before the suitors to inflame their desire and to increase her worth in the eyes of her husband and son. Adorned by Athena with divine beauty, Penelope descends to the great hall. She chastises Telemachus for allowing the beggar (Odysseus) to be mistreated and then addresses the suitors, reminding them that proper suitors bring gifts rather than consuming the household's wealth. Eager to impress her, the suitors send servants to bring gifts of jewelry, fine robes, and other treasures.

As evening falls, the suitors bring in braziers to light the hall. Odysseus offers to tend the fires, but Melantho, a disloyal maidservant who is sleeping with one of the suitors, insults him. Odysseus sternly warns her of coming retribution. The suitors, particularly Eurymachus, mock Odysseus and even throw a footstool at him, which he dodges. Telemachus intervenes, asserting his authority in the household and sending the suitors home for the night. Though resentful, the suitors depart, concluding the day's events.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 18 as a philosophical exploration of the theme of appearance versus reality and its relationship to justice. The various confrontations in this book—with Irus, Melantho, and the suitors—represent what Benardete sees as tests of Odysseus's self-control and strategic wisdom as he prepares for the final reckoning.

Benardete pays particular attention to the fight with Irus, interpreting it as a philosophical reflection on the nature of moderation in the use of power. Odysseus's decision to strike Irus hard enough to disable him but not to kill him represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical virtue of restraint that distinguishes the just ruler from the tyrant. This restraint illustrates what Benardete sees as Odysseus's capacity to use force proportionally rather than excessively, a key attribute of legitimate political authority.

The transformation of Penelope by Athena represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical meditation on the relationship between beauty, desire, and political power. By enhancing Penelope's beauty to inflame the suitors' desire, Athena creates what Benardete sees as a situation where the suitors' own passions contribute to their downfall. Their eagerness to bring gifts illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical insight that excessive desire can blind men to the dangers that surround them.

The warning Odysseus gives to Amphinomus represents what Benardete sees as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between choice and fate. Despite being warned and being troubled by the warning, Amphinomus cannot escape the destiny that binds him to the other suitors. This inability to act on the warning illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical problem of akrasia—weakness of will or the inability to act on knowledge—that affects even the most reasonable of the suitors.

The insults from Melantho and Eurymachus represent what Benardete interprets as the ultimate corruption of the household's moral order. The servant who should be loyal to her mistress instead sleeps with one of the suitors, while the guest who should respect his host instead abuses the household's resources. These inversions illustrate what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of the perversion of natural relationships that characterizes the suitors' occupation of Odysseus's house.

## Notable Passages

> "Don't provoke the man. Don't lay a hand on him, or you will face my wrath. This is my father's house, and I am master here."

Telemachus's assertion of authority represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of the restoration of legitimate rule. This statement illustrates the beginning of the reestablishment of proper order in the household, with the son claiming his rightful place in his father's absence.

> "Hear me, you lords who court the famous queen! I must say what the heart inside me urges. This stranger—I don't know who he is or where he comes from—has reached Odysseus's house. Do you think he came here for no reason? Nothing happens without god's will."

Amphinomus's statement after Odysseus defeats Irus represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical insight that divine purpose may be at work even in seemingly random events. This perspective illustrates what Benardete identifies as the theological dimension of justice in the Homeric world.

> "Stranger, I warn you for your own good—take my advice: stop working the estates and begging through the country. Soon the dear son of Odysseus will come home. He's here already. He'll give those men the wages they deserve."

Melantho's sister's warning to the disguised Odysseus represents what Benardete interprets as an ironic truth-telling that operates beyond the speaker's conscious intention. Without realizing it, she predicts exactly what will happen, illustrating what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of truth emerging even through the words of those who do not recognize it.
