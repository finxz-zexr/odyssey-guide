# Book 7: Phaeacia's Halls and Gardens

## Summary

Book 7 follows Odysseus as he enters the magnificent palace of the Phaeacians. As he approaches the city, Athena disguises herself as a young girl and guides him to the palace, shrouding him in mist for protection. She describes the royal family to him, emphasizing Queen Arete's importance and influence.

Odysseus enters the palace and is awestruck by its splendor—bronze walls, gold doors, silver posts, and magical gardens that bear fruit year-round. He finds the king and queen at dinner with Phaeacian nobles. Following Nausicaa's advice, he approaches Queen Arete first, embracing her knees in supplication. When the mist dissipates, the Phaeacians are startled by his sudden appearance.

An elderly counselor, Echeneus, reminds King Alcinous of the proper hospitality rites. Alcinous welcomes Odysseus, offering him food, drink, and a seat of honor. After the feast, when most guests have departed, Arete recognizes the clothes Odysseus is wearing as those she made for her daughter. She questions him about how he obtained them.

Odysseus recounts his journey from Calypso's island, his shipwreck, and his encounter with Nausicaa, carefully omitting any details that might compromise the princess's reputation. Impressed by his tale and his noble bearing, Alcinous suggests that Odysseus might make a suitable husband for Nausicaa. However, he also promises to arrange for Odysseus's safe passage home the next day. The book ends with Odysseus being provided a comfortable bed for the night, his first proper rest since leaving Calypso's island.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 7 as a crucial exploration of the Phaeacians' unique position between the divine and human realms. The Phaeacians live in what Benardete calls a "human paradise" that exists "without pain or suffering," a middle ground between Calypso's divine island and the harsh realities of Ithaca.

Benardete pays particular attention to the description of the Phaeacian gardens, which bear fruit year-round in an eternal cycle of growth. This perpetual fruitfulness represents what Benardete sees as the Phaeacians' existence outside normal human time—they live in a kind of eternal present, untouched by the historical conflicts that define the rest of the human world.

The political structure of Phaeacia also interests Benardete. King Alcinous rules with the twelve other Phaeacian kings, a system that Benardete interprets as representing an idealized aristocracy. Yet Queen Arete holds unusual power for a woman in this world, settling disputes among men—a detail that Benardete sees as indicating the Phaeacians' deviation from normal human political arrangements.

Odysseus's decision to approach Arete first, following both Nausicaa's and Athena's advice, demonstrates what Benardete calls his political wisdom—his ability to recognize and adapt to the unique power dynamics of each society he encounters. This adaptability is central to Benardete's understanding of Odysseus as a philosophical figure who must navigate between different political and cosmic orders.

The tension between Alcinous's suggestion that Odysseus might marry Nausicaa and his promise to help Odysseus return home represents what Benardete sees as the fundamental choice Odysseus faces: to remain in the pleasant but ultimately unreal world of Phaeacia or to continue his journey back to the imperfect but real world of Ithaca. Having already chosen mortality over immortality with Calypso, Odysseus now implicitly chooses human reality over human fantasy.

## Notable Passages

> "Their fruits never fail or flag, winter and summer alike they grow the whole year through—for the West Wind's breath will always ripen some while others come to bloom."

The description of the Phaeacian gardens represents what Benardete identifies as their existence outside normal human time, a key philosophical theme in his reading of the Odyssey.

> "Her majesty Arete is her name, born of the same line that produced King Alcinous. Poseidon, god of the earthquake, fathered Nausithous first..."

The detailed genealogy that Athena provides to Odysseus illustrates what Benardete sees as the importance of understanding the origins and nature of political power in each community Odysseus encounters.

> "Stranger, the question is mine to put to you first. Who are you? Where from? Who gave you the clothes you're wearing now? Didn't you say you reached us roving on the sea?"

Arete's direct questioning of Odysseus demonstrates what Benardete identifies as her unusual political authority and her role as a kind of judge or examiner of strangers—a role typically reserved for men in the ancient world.
