# Book 23: The Great Rooted Bed

## Summary

Book 23 focuses on the emotional reunion between Odysseus and Penelope after twenty years of separation. The book begins with Eurycleia, the elderly nurse, rushing upstairs to Penelope's chamber to announce that Odysseus has returned and slain the suitors. Penelope, however, remains skeptical, believing that some god must have killed the suitors and that her husband is truly dead.

When Penelope descends to the hall and sees Odysseus sitting by the hearth, she still hesitates to accept his identity. Telemachus grows frustrated with his mother's caution, but Odysseus understands her need for certainty. He suggests that he should bathe and dress in clean clothes first, and then they will decide what to do next. He also instructs Telemachus to arrange for music and dancing to disguise the sounds of the slaughter from neighbors, buying them time before news of the suitors' deaths spreads through the city.

After bathing, Odysseus returns to the hall, enhanced in appearance by Athena. He gently reproaches Penelope for her hesitation, then sits down to wait for her to recognize him. Penelope, still uncertain, decides to test him by ordering Eurycleia to move Odysseus's bed outside the bedchamber. Odysseus reacts with anger, explaining that their marriage bed was built around an olive tree still rooted in the ground, making it immovable—a secret known only to the two of them and a single servant.

This intimate knowledge finally convinces Penelope of his identity, and she rushes to embrace him, explaining that she had feared being deceived by an impostor. Their joyful reunion brings tears to both, and they spend the night together, first sharing their stories and then making love.

Odysseus tells Penelope about his adventures and about Tiresias's prophecy that he must make one more journey inland, carrying an oar until he reaches people who know nothing of the sea. Penelope tells him of her long years of waiting and her strategies for delaying the suitors.

As dawn approaches, Odysseus prepares to leave the palace to visit his father, Laertes. He instructs Penelope to remain in her upper chamber with her women, not showing herself, as they must still deal with the consequences of the suitors' slaughter.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 23 as a philosophical exploration of the theme of recognition and its relationship to marriage and political order. The reunion between Odysseus and Penelope represents what Benardete sees as the final and most crucial recognition scene in the epic, completing the restoration of both domestic and political order.

Benardete pays particular attention to Penelope's hesitation to recognize Odysseus, interpreting it as a philosophical reflection on the nature of certainty in human relationships. Unlike Eurycleia, who recognizes Odysseus by his scar (a physical sign), or Telemachus, who accepts his father's identity based on divine transformation, Penelope requires what Benardete identifies as a different kind of proof—knowledge that could only be shared between husband and wife. This requirement illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical insight that the most intimate relationships demand the most certain forms of recognition.

The immovable bed represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical symbol of the marriage bond itself. Built around a living olive tree, the bed combines what Benardete sees as natural permanence (the rooted tree) with human craft (the bed constructed around it). This combination symbolizes what Benardete identifies as the philosophical understanding of marriage as both a natural and a conventional bond—rooted in nature but shaped by human intention and commitment.

The sharing of stories between Odysseus and Penelope represents what Benardete sees as a philosophical reflection on the role of narrative in establishing identity. By telling each other what has happened during their twenty years apart, Odysseus and Penelope bridge what Benardete identifies as the temporal gap in their relationship. This exchange of narratives illustrates the philosophical insight that personal identity across time is maintained and recognized through the stories we tell about ourselves and others.

The prophecy about Odysseus's future journey inland represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical meditation on the incompleteness of homecoming. Even after returning to Ithaca and reclaiming his household, Odysseus must undertake one more journey to people who know nothing of the sea. This requirement illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of the tension between settlement and wandering that characterizes human existence—even the most complete return contains within it the seed of future departure.

## Notable Passages

> "Strange woman! The gods of Olympus have made you more stubborn than any other woman. What other wife could have the heart to keep herself from her husband, home at last after twenty years of hardship? Very well then, Eurycleia, make up a bed for me to sleep on alone. Her heart is iron."

Odysseus's response to Penelope's continued caution represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of the tension between male and female perspectives on recognition. This statement illustrates what Benardete sees as the different temporal orientations of Odysseus (focused on the present moment of return) and Penelope (concerned with the possibility of future deception).

> "Our bed? Odysseus? But dear, how could any man alive, no matter how young and strong, easily move our bed? The secret of our bed is a great mystery. I built it myself, no one else... There was a branching olive tree inside our courtyard... Around this olive tree I built our bedroom... That was our sign, our secret, that no one knew but ourselves."

Odysseus's description of the immovable bed represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical symbol of the marriage bond itself. This description illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical understanding of marriage as combining natural permanence (the living tree) with human craft and commitment (the bed built around it).

> "Don't rage at me, Odysseus! No one has ever matched your caution! The gods gave us pain, the gods begrudged us living together, enjoying our youth, and reaching together the threshold of old age. So don't be angry that I didn't welcome you immediately. My heart within me always feared some man might come and deceive me with his words. Many men scheme for wicked advantage."

Penelope's explanation for her caution represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between deception and recognition. This statement illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical insight that in a world where appearances can be manipulated, caution about identity claims becomes a necessary virtue rather than a moral failing.
