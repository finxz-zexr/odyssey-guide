# Book 8: A Day for Songs and Contests

## Summary

Book 8 describes Odysseus's first full day among the Phaeacians. King Alcinous calls an assembly and announces plans to help the stranger return home. He orders a ship to be prepared and invites the nobles to a feast in Odysseus's honor, with the renowned bard Demodocus providing entertainment.

At the feast, Demodocus sings about a quarrel between Odysseus and Achilles during the Trojan War. This song moves Odysseus to tears, which he tries to hide. Only Alcinous notices his distress. After the meal, the Phaeacians move to the athletic field for sporting competitions. When Odysseus declines to participate, a young Phaeacian named Broadsea taunts him, suggesting he's a mere merchant, not a true athlete.

Provoked, Odysseus responds with an impressive discus throw that far outstrips all others. Emboldened by his success, he challenges the Phaeacians to any contest except running (acknowledging his weakened condition from his ordeal at sea). Alcinous defuses the tension by calling for dancing and music.

Demodocus then sings a humorous tale about the love affair between Ares and Aphrodite and how Hephaestus caught them in a magical net. After more dancing, Odysseus receives gifts from the Phaeacian nobles. At the evening feast, Odysseus asks Demodocus to sing about the Trojan Horse. When this song again brings Odysseus to tears, Alcinous finally asks him to reveal his identity and tell his story.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 8 as a crucial exploration of the relationship between poetry, truth, and emotion. The three songs of Demodocus represent different aspects of poetic truth-telling and their effects on the listener, particularly Odysseus.

Benardete pays special attention to Odysseus's tears, which he interprets as a response to hearing his own story told by another. This creates what Benardete calls a "doubling" of consciousness—Odysseus experiences himself both as the subject and the object of the narrative. This doubling is central to Benardete's understanding of the philosophical dimension of the Odyssey, as it raises questions about self-knowledge and the relationship between experience and reflection.

The athletic contests represent what Benardete sees as another kind of "testing" of Odysseus's identity. When provoked by Broadsea, Odysseus reveals aspects of himself that he had been concealing—his physical prowess and his eloquence in defending his honor. This partial revelation foreshadows the full disclosure of his identity that will come at the end of the book.

Demodocus's song about Ares and Aphrodite introduces what Benardete identifies as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between love, craft, and deception. Hephaestus, the craftsman god, uses his technical skill to expose and contain the deceptive lovers. This story serves as a metaphor for the poet's own craft—using artifice to reveal truth—and for Odysseus's own complex relationship with deception and revelation.

The final song about the Trojan Horse brings together these themes of craft, deception, and revelation. The horse, like poetry itself, conceals truth within a deceptive exterior. Odysseus, as the architect of the Trojan Horse stratagem, is moved to tears by hearing his own cunning plan described from the outside. This moment represents what Benardete sees as the culmination of the "poetic dialectic" that runs through Book 8—the interplay between concealment and revelation, between experiencing and telling.

## Notable Passages

> "So the famous singer sang his tale, but Odysseus melted, and from under his eyes the tears ran down, drenching his cheeks. As a woman weeps, lying over the body of her dear husband, who fell fighting for her city and people..."

This description of Odysseus's tears illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical significance of emotional response to poetry—the way in which hearing one's own story told by another creates a form of self-knowledge unavailable through direct experience.

> "I'm no champion, not in your sense of the word... My mind is always fixed on the cares of my heart. I've suffered much and labored long, come through many wars and weathered hard seas. After all that misery, here I sit in your assembly still."

Odysseus's response to Broadsea's taunt reveals what Benardete sees as the tension between different forms of excellence—athletic prowess versus the endurance and cunning that have kept Odysseus alive through his ordeals.

> "Come, friend, you ask me this yourself, ask me directly: what is your name? Tell me what they call you at home—your mother, your father, your neighbors, your townsmen."

Alcinous's direct request for Odysseus to reveal his identity represents what Benardete identifies as the culmination of the process of testing and revelation that runs through Book 8, setting the stage for Odysseus's own narrative in the books to follow.
