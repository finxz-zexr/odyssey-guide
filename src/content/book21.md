# Book 21: Odysseus Strings His Bow

## Summary

Book 21 centers on the contest of the bow, which will lead directly to the slaughter of the suitors. The book begins with Penelope retrieving Odysseus's great bow from the storeroom, along with a set of twelve axes. This bow, a gift from Iphitus, has remained unused since Odysseus left for Troy. Penelope brings these items to the great hall and announces the contest to the suitors: whoever can string the bow and shoot an arrow through the twelve axe heads will become her husband.

Telemachus sets up the axes in a straight line and is the first to attempt to string the bow. After nearly succeeding on his fourth try, he stops at a signal from his father. The suitors then take turns trying to string the bow, starting with Leodes, the soothsayer, who fails and predicts the bow will be the death of many. Antinous suggests warming the bow with fat to make it more pliable, but even this doesn't help.

Meanwhile, Odysseus reveals his identity to two loyal servants outside the palace—Eumaeus the swineherd and Philoetius the cowherd. He shows them his scar as proof and enlists their help in the coming slaughter. He instructs Eumaeus to bring him the bow after the suitors fail and tells Philoetius to lock the courtyard gates.

Back in the hall, Eurymachus struggles with the bow and is humiliated by his failure. Antinous suggests postponing the contest until the next day, when they can make proper sacrifices to Apollo, the archer god. The disguised Odysseus then asks to try the bow, causing an uproar among the suitors. Penelope insists he be allowed to try, but Telemachus asserts his authority over the bow and sends his mother back to her chambers.

After Eumaeus brings the bow to Odysseus, the suitors mock him, but he easily strings it and sends an arrow through all twelve axes. He then signals to Telemachus with a nod, and the prince arms himself, standing ready by his father's side as the book ends.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 21 as a philosophical exploration of the theme of skill and its relationship to legitimate rule. The contest of the bow represents what Benardete sees as a test that reveals the true nature of both the suitors and Odysseus.

Benardete pays particular attention to the bow itself, interpreting it as a symbol of Odysseus's unique excellence. The fact that no one else can string it illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of the non-transferability of certain forms of excellence—some abilities are so closely tied to individual identity that they cannot be replicated by others. This non-transferability symbolizes what Benardete sees as the philosophical basis of Odysseus's exclusive right to rule in Ithaca.

The revelation of Odysseus's identity to Eumaeus and Philoetius represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the nature of political alliance. By showing his scar—the same mark by which Eurycleia recognized him—Odysseus creates what Benardete calls a "community of knowledge" that forms the basis of political action. This selective revelation illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical insight that political restoration requires a core group of loyal supporters who recognize the legitimate ruler.

Telemachus's near-success in stringing the bow represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of inheritance and succession. As Odysseus's son, Telemachus comes closest to possessing his father's skill, suggesting what Benardete sees as a natural basis for political succession. However, his inability to complete the task illustrates the philosophical insight that legitimate rule requires not just hereditary right but personal excellence.

The suitors' failure with the bow represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical demonstration of their unfitness to replace Odysseus. Their inability to string the bow reveals what Benardete sees as their fundamental inadequacy—they lack the essential quality that defines Odysseus and legitimizes his rule. This failure illustrates the philosophical theme of the relationship between skill and political legitimacy that runs throughout the epic.

## Notable Passages

> "Come, my good suitors, now that this prize is set before you... I will take up the well-sprung bow of godlike Odysseus. And whoever most easily strings the bow and shoots an arrow through all twelve axes, with him I will go, leaving this house where I was once a bride, this lovely house filled with all our treasure. I will remember it, I think, even in my dreams."

Penelope's announcement of the contest represents what Benardete sees as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between skill and marriage rights. By setting this test, Penelope establishes what Benardete identifies as a criterion that only Odysseus can meet, illustrating the philosophical theme of the inseparability of Odysseus's identity from his unique abilities.

> "Friends, my hands are useless, my strength is gone. Or am I just too young and can't rely on my hands to fight off a man who wrongs me first? Come, you who are stronger than I am, try to string the bow. Let's get this contest over with."

Leodes's admission of failure represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical recognition of the gap between ordinary human capability and exceptional excellence. This recognition illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical insight that some forms of excellence are not accessible to all, regardless of effort or intention.

> "Here is my sign for you. No other Achaean can bend and string this bow with ease, as I just did. Only Odysseus. That's your proof."

Odysseus's words to Eumaeus and Philoetius represent what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of recognition through demonstration. Rather than merely claiming his identity, Odysseus proves it through an action that only he can perform, illustrating what Benardete sees as the philosophical connection between identity and distinctive excellence.
