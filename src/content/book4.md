# Book 4: The King and Queen of Sparta

## Summary

Book 4 continues Telemachus's journey as he and Pisistratus arrive at the palace of Menelaus in Sparta. They find Menelaus celebrating the double wedding of his son and daughter. Despite the festivities, Menelaus welcomes the young men and offers them hospitality before even asking their identities—a demonstration of proper guest-friendship (xenia).

During the feast, Helen, Menelaus's wife, recognizes Telemachus by his resemblance to Odysseus. This revelation moves everyone to tears as they remember those lost in the Trojan War. To ease their grief, Helen adds a drug to their wine that banishes sorrow, and then she and Menelaus share stories about Odysseus's cleverness during the war, including his role in the Trojan Horse stratagem.

The next day, Menelaus recounts his difficult journey home from Troy, including his encounter with Proteus, the shape-shifting sea god. From Proteus, Menelaus learned that Odysseus was being held captive on Calypso's island. This is the first concrete news Telemachus has received about his father's fate. Menelaus urges Telemachus to stay in Sparta longer, but Telemachus insists he must return to Ithaca.

Meanwhile, back in Ithaca, the suitors learn of Telemachus's secret departure and plot to ambush and kill him upon his return. Penelope, initially unaware of her son's journey, is distraught when she learns of it and of the suitors' plot. The goddess Athena sends a phantom in the form of Penelope's sister to comfort her in a dream, assuring her that Telemachus is under divine protection.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete sees Book 4 as pivotal in developing the theme of appearance versus reality, which is central to his Platonic reading of the Odyssey. The book presents multiple layers of storytelling and memory, raising questions about how knowledge is acquired and transmitted.

Benardete pays particular attention to Helen's drug that banishes sorrow, seeing it as a metaphor for the selective nature of memory. By selecting some memories and covering others, Helen's drug acts like poetry itself, which in its doubleness affects both the mind and the heart. Benardete writes: "Helen seems to have all the traits of the poet, from the coolness with which Homer depicts the most terrible things to his mimetic capacity to make things appear in all their vividness and his insight into the hiddenness of things."

The stories told by Helen and Menelaus present contradictory versions of Odysseus—Helen portrays him as a self-mutilated beggar entering Troy, while Menelaus recounts his iron self-control inside the Trojan Horse. These dual narratives reflect what Benardete calls the "poetic dialectic" that brings moral ambiguity into the epic. The contradictions are not resolved but left to create a more complex understanding of Odysseus's character.

Menelaus's encounter with Proteus represents another philosophical dimension: the pursuit of truth requires confronting constant change and transformation. Proteus, the shape-shifter, must be held firmly despite his metamorphoses before he will reveal the truth. This serves as a metaphor for the philosophical quest for stable knowledge in a world of appearances.

The parallel narratives of Sparta and Ithaca create what Benardete calls a "duality" in the structure of the epic itself. While Telemachus gains knowledge about his father in Sparta, the situation in Ithaca deteriorates, with the suitors plotting his murder. This structural duality reflects the philosophical tension between knowledge and action, between learning the truth and implementing justice.

## Notable Passages

> "Such drugs of subtle craft and power had the daughter of Zeus, drugs that Polydamna, the wife of Thon, had given her in Egypt."

Helen's drug symbolizes what Benardete sees as the power of poetry to selectively reveal and conceal, creating a particular emotional and intellectual experience for its audience.

> "What a piece of work the hero dared and carried off in the wooden horse, where all our best encamped, our champions armed with bloody death for Troy..."

Helen's story about Odysseus highlights his capacity for disguise and deception, themes that Benardete connects to the philosophical question of appearance versus reality.

> "But he, with his great heart, endured it all until our voices called our scheme to light and great Odysseus answered you at last."

Menelaus's contrasting story emphasizes Odysseus's self-control, creating a dual image of the hero as both deceptive and disciplined—a duality that Benardete sees as essential to Homer's philosophical portrayal of human nature.
