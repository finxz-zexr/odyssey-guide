# Book 14: The Loyal Swineherd

## Summary

Book 14 follows Odysseus, now disguised as an elderly beggar, as he makes his way to the hut of Eumaeus, his loyal swineherd. As Odysseus approaches, he is attacked by Eumaeus's dogs but is saved when Eumaeus drives them away. The swineherd, not recognizing his master, welcomes the stranger with exceptional hospitality, offering him food, drink, and shelter.

During their conversation, Eumaeus expresses his deep loyalty to his long-absent master and his contempt for the suitors who are devouring Odysseus's wealth. He also shares his concern for Telemachus, who has gone to Sparta and might face an ambush from the suitors upon his return. Throughout their exchange, Eumaeus repeatedly refers to Odysseus as his "master" despite believing him to be dead, demonstrating his unwavering faithfulness.

Odysseus, maintaining his disguise, fabricates an elaborate tale about being a Cretan warrior who fought at Troy, suffered many misfortunes, and eventually came to Ithaca after hearing rumors that Odysseus was alive and on his way home. Eumaeus remains skeptical of this news, having been deceived by other travelers seeking rewards with false tales of Odysseus.

As night falls, Odysseus tests Eumaeus's hospitality by suggesting he might sleep outside due to the cold. Eumaeus insists the stranger stay in his hut and even gives him his own cloak. To further entertain his guest, Eumaeus tells his own life story: he was born to a noble family but was kidnapped as a child by his nurse and sold into slavery, eventually coming into Odysseus's household.

The book ends with Eumaeus and Odysseus sleeping in the hut while Eumaeus's fellow herders sleep outside. Eumaeus demonstrates his vigilance and responsibility by arming himself and going out to check on the swine despite the cold night, further proving his worth as a loyal servant.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 14 as a philosophical exploration of the nature of loyalty and recognition in a political community. The encounter between the disguised Odysseus and Eumaeus represents what Benardete sees as a testing of the bonds that hold a household together in the absence of its master.

Benardete pays particular attention to Eumaeus's status as a slave who nonetheless demonstrates the virtues of a free man. His exceptional hospitality toward a stranger and his unwavering loyalty to an absent master represent what Benardete identifies as the philosophical ideal of natural nobility that transcends social status. Eumaeus's behavior illustrates the Homeric insight that true worth is determined by character rather than birth or social position.

The false tale Odysseus tells Eumaeus represents what Benardete calls a "noble lie" that contains deeper truths within its fictional framework. By presenting himself as a Cretan warrior who suffered misfortunes similar to Odysseus's own, the disguised king creates what Benardete sees as a philosophical doubling—a fictional version of himself that allows him to observe how others respond to his story. This strategy illustrates the philosophical theme of self-knowledge through self-concealment that runs throughout the epic.

Eumaeus's skepticism toward news of Odysseus's return represents what Benardete identifies as a philosophical tension between hope and experience. Having been deceived before by travelers with false tales, Eumaeus has learned to distrust such reports even while maintaining his loyalty to Odysseus. This tension illustrates what Benardete sees as the complex relationship between faith and doubt in human affairs.

The detailed description of Eumaeus's hut and his careful management of Odysseus's property represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the nature of good stewardship. In contrast to the suitors who consume Odysseus's wealth without contributing anything, Eumaeus maintains and even increases his master's property. This contrast illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical distinction between legitimate and illegitimate use of resources in a political community.

## Notable Passages

> "May Zeus and the other immortals grant him all he wants most, this man who took me in with such kindness, let me sleep in his own bed while he, poor fellow, will spend the night out here."

Odysseus's internal thoughts about Eumaeus represent what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of reciprocity that underlies proper social relations. The recognition of kindness creates an obligation to return it, forming the basis of social bonds.

> "But my heart breaks for Odysseus... I care for him more than all the rest—even though he's gone, I can't bring myself to speak of him by name. So deeply he loved me, cared for me, so much I miss him, my master, lost and gone!"

Eumaeus's expression of loyalty illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical ideal of devotion that transcends self-interest. His continued loyalty to an absent master who may never return represents a form of virtue that exists for its own sake rather than for reward.

> "I hate lying as I hate the gates of Hades, any man who, ground down by poverty, tells his tales of woe to cheat his way along."

This statement by Odysseus (while telling a lie himself) represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical paradox of necessary deception. In a world where truth can be dangerous, sometimes falsehood becomes necessary for survival and eventual justice. This paradox illustrates the complex moral landscape of the Odyssey, where simple ethical rules must sometimes be suspended in service of a higher good.
