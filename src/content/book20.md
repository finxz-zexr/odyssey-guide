# Book 20: Portents Gather

## Summary

Book 20 depicts the day before the slaughter of the suitors, filled with divine omens and rising tension. The book begins with Odysseus, still disguised as a beggar, lying sleepless in the palace entryway, watching the disloyal maidservants as they sneak out to sleep with the suitors. He struggles to control his anger, debating whether to kill them immediately or wait for his larger plan of revenge.

Athena appears to reassure him, and she eventually grants him sleep. Meanwhile, Penelope also lies awake, weeping and praying for death or for Odysseus's return. She recounts a dream in which she saw her husband lying beside her, appearing as he did when he left for Troy. When she finally falls asleep, Odysseus wakes and prays to Zeus for a favorable sign. Zeus responds with a thunderclap from a clear sky, which Odysseus interprets as divine approval for his plan.

As the day begins, the palace prepares for a feast honoring Apollo. The loyal servants, including the elderly nurse Eurycleia and the cowherd Philoetius, go about their duties. Philoetius notices the beggar (Odysseus) and expresses sympathy for him, sharing his own loyalty to the absent king. Odysseus, still in disguise, assures him that Odysseus will return before he leaves the hall.

The suitors arrive and once again plot to kill Telemachus, but an omen—an eagle flying with a dove in its talons—causes Amphinomus to advise against it. During the feast, the suitors continue to mistreat Odysseus. Ctesippus, a particularly arrogant suitor, throws an ox hoof at him, which Odysseus dodges. Telemachus sternly rebukes Ctesippus and asserts his authority in the household, warning the suitors that he is no longer a child to be pushed around.

The seer Theoclymenus, observing the suitors, suddenly has a terrifying vision: he sees the hall filled with blood, the walls dripping with gore, and the suitors' heads enveloped in night. He prophesies their imminent doom and flees the palace. The suitors mock his prophecy and continue their revelry, also mocking Telemachus for the "wretched guests" he entertains—the beggar (Odysseus) and the "raving" prophet.

The book ends with the suitors feasting, unaware that this will be their last meal, while Athena intensifies their reckless behavior to ensure they will provide justification for Odysseus's vengeance.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 20 as a philosophical exploration of the theme of divine justice and its relationship to human action. The various omens and prophecies in this book represent what Benardete sees as the theological dimension of the restoration of order that Odysseus is about to undertake.

Benardete pays particular attention to Odysseus's inner struggle at the beginning of the book, interpreting it as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between anger and justice. Odysseus's debate with himself about whether to kill the disloyal maidservants immediately illustrates what Benardete identifies as the tension between emotional reaction and strategic action that characterizes the hero's approach to justice. His decision to wait represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical virtue of self-restraint that distinguishes just vengeance from mere retaliation.

The thunderclap from Zeus represents what Benardete interprets as divine sanction for human justice. This sign illustrates what Benardete sees as the theological foundation of political order in the Homeric world—the belief that legitimate authority ultimately derives from divine approval. The fact that the thunder comes from a clear sky symbolizes what Benardete identifies as the mysterious nature of divine intervention, which operates beyond ordinary natural causality.

Theoclymenus's vision of blood and gore represents what Benardete sees as prophetic insight into the true nature of the situation. While the suitors perceive themselves as honored guests enjoying a feast, the seer perceives their true status as victims awaiting slaughter. This contrast illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of appearance versus reality that runs throughout the epic—the gap between how things appear to ordinary perception and how they appear to those with deeper insight.

The suitors' mockery of Theoclymenus represents what Benardete interprets as the ultimate blindness that precedes destruction. By dismissing the prophet's warning, the suitors demonstrate what Benardete sees as the philosophical condition of ate (moral blindness) that makes them unable to recognize the signs of their impending doom. This blindness illustrates the philosophical insight that those about to be punished by divine justice are first deprived of the ability to perceive their danger.

## Notable Passages

> "How, how can I handle these shameless, insolent men? They outnumber me, swarms of them against one... What if they kill me—an ambush—alone as I am? Or should I hold out until I pay them back for all their outrage?"

Odysseus's inner debate represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical problem of practical wisdom in the face of injustice. This moment illustrates the tension between immediate emotional response and strategic patience that characterizes Odysseus's approach to restoring justice.

> "You've lost your grip on reality. Your brains are addled, your head and face are shrouded in night, you're burning with fever! The walls, the handsome crossbeams of the roof—they're swimming in blood and fire! The porch is filled with ghosts, the court is filled with ghosts, all whirling down to darkness, down to hell, the sun is blotted from the skies—look there—a lethal mist spreads all across the earth!"

Theoclymenus's vision represents what Benardete sees as prophetic insight into the true nature of the suitors' situation. This description illustrates the philosophical theme of the gap between ordinary perception and deeper truth, between how things appear to the suitors and how they appear to those with divine insight.

> "Poor strangers, my house has been their ruin! Like Theoclymenus there, they come from foreign parts, and now my fine beggar's the butt of your sport—you throw things at him, work your outrage on him. Well, it's no fault of mine, no blame to my mother either. It's the gods' work, spinning threads of death."

Telemachus's ironic statement represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of dramatic irony that characterizes the latter part of the epic. Without realizing it, Telemachus speaks a deeper truth than he intends, illustrating the philosophical insight that human speech can convey meanings beyond the speaker's conscious intention.
