# Book 19: The Queen and the Beggar

## Summary

Book 19 centers on the pivotal meeting between Penelope and the disguised Odysseus. The book begins with Odysseus and Telemachus removing all weapons from the great hall and storing them in an upper chamber, as planned. Athena lights their way with a golden lamp, which Telemachus perceives as a divine presence.

After Telemachus retires for the night, Penelope comes down to the hall to speak with the beggar (Odysseus). She sits near the fire and questions him about his identity. Odysseus, still maintaining his disguise, claims to be a Cretan nobleman named Aethon, a brother of Idomeneus. He tells an elaborate false tale about his life and claims to have once hosted Odysseus when he stopped in Crete on his way to Troy.

Penelope, moved by his story, weeps for her husband. She then describes her own situation—how she has delayed the suitors for years by weaving and unweaving a shroud for Laertes, Odysseus's father, until the trick was discovered. Now she is being pressed to choose a husband from among the suitors.

To test the stranger's claim of having met Odysseus, Penelope asks him to describe what Odysseus was wearing when they met. Odysseus provides such precise details about his own clothing and appearance from twenty years ago that Penelope is convinced he truly met her husband. Her weeping intensifies, and Odysseus, though filled with compassion, maintains his composure, keeping "his eyes as steady as horn or iron."

Penelope then offers the beggar a foot bath and comfortable lodging for the night. The elderly nurse Eurycleia is summoned to wash his feet. As she does so, she notices a scar on his thigh from a boar hunt in his youth and immediately recognizes her master. Odysseus quickly silences her and makes her swear not to reveal his identity, even to Penelope.

After the foot bath, Odysseus and Penelope resume their conversation. Penelope describes a dream she had of an eagle killing her geese, which the eagle then interprets as Odysseus killing the suitors. She also announces her intention to hold a contest the next day: whoever can string Odysseus's bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads will become her husband. Though Odysseus encourages this plan, Penelope remains torn about whether to remarry or continue waiting for her husband's return.

The book ends with Penelope returning to her chambers and Odysseus preparing to sleep in the hallway, setting the stage for the contest and slaughter to come.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 19 as a philosophical exploration of the theme of recognition and its relationship to identity and knowledge. The conversation between Penelope and the disguised Odysseus represents what Benardete sees as a complex interplay between concealment and revelation, between conscious and unconscious forms of knowing.

Benardete pays particular attention to the moment when Eurycleia recognizes Odysseus by his scar. This recognition represents what Benardete identifies as a form of knowledge based on physical signs rather than speech or appearance. The scar, a mark from Odysseus's youth that has remained unchanged through all his transformations, symbolizes what Benardete sees as the philosophical problem of personal identity across time—what makes someone the same person despite changes in appearance and circumstance.

The narrator's digression into the story of how Odysseus got his scar represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between past and present. The detailed account of the boar hunt and Odysseus's naming by his grandfather Autolycus illustrates what Benardete sees as the importance of origins and naming in establishing identity. This digression creates what Benardete calls a "doubling" of time, where the past exists simultaneously with the present, illustrating the philosophical theme of temporal complexity that runs throughout the epic.

Penelope's dream of the eagle killing her geese represents what Benardete identifies as a form of unconscious knowledge. Without consciously recognizing her husband, Penelope's dream suggests an intuitive awareness of his presence and the coming slaughter of the suitors. This dream illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of knowledge that exists below the level of conscious awareness, suggesting that Penelope may "know" her husband is present without explicitly recognizing him.

The decision to hold the bow contest represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between skill and identity. The ability to string Odysseus's bow and shoot through the axe heads requires not just strength but the specific kind of skill that characterizes Odysseus himself. This test illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical insight that certain abilities are so closely tied to identity that they can serve as a means of recognition.

## Notable Passages

> "My eyes are steady as horn or iron. That's how I hold them now, and that's how they'll stay."

Odysseus's control of his emotions while Penelope weeps represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of self-mastery that characterizes the hero. This restraint illustrates the tension between emotional response and strategic necessity that Odysseus must navigate throughout his return.

> "Stranger, dreams are hard to unravel, wandering things that they are, not all we see in them will come to pass... Two gates there are for our evanescent dreams, one is made of ivory, the other made of horn. Those that pass through the ivory cleanly carved are will-o'-the-wisps, their message bears no fruit. The dreams that pass through the gates of polished horn are fraught with truth for the dreamer who can see them."

Penelope's reflection on dreams represents what Benardete sees as a philosophical meditation on the nature of prophetic knowledge. The distinction between true and false dreams illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical problem of distinguishing genuine insight from mere fantasy, a problem that parallels the larger theme of recognizing Odysseus beneath his disguise.

> "Here is my heart's desire, my burning wish: to take the great bow of Odysseus in my hands, to string it with ease, and send an arrow hurtling through all twelve axes, clean as a whistle. Then I would follow my husband, yes, forsaking this house where I was once a bride, this gracious house so rich with food and warmth. A house I will remember, I think, even in my dreams."

Penelope's description of the bow contest represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between memory, desire, and identity. Her attachment to her first home with Odysseus illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of nostalgia—the painful longing for return—that mirrors Odysseus's own desire to reclaim his household.
