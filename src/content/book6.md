# Book 6: The Princess and the Stranger

## Summary

Book 6 introduces the Phaeacians, particularly Princess Nausicaa, who plays a crucial role in Odysseus's journey home. The book begins with Athena visiting Nausicaa in a dream, disguised as her friend. The goddess encourages the princess to go to the river to wash her clothes, subtly suggesting that marriage may be in her near future.

The next morning, Nausicaa asks her father, King Alcinous, for a wagon to take laundry to the washing pools. After she and her handmaidens finish their washing, they play a ball game on the beach. Their shouts awaken Odysseus, who has been sleeping in the nearby thicket since his shipwreck.

Odysseus emerges from the bushes, naked and covered in brine, frightening away all the handmaidens except Nausicaa. Though initially startled, Nausicaa stands her ground as Odysseus makes a carefully crafted supplication speech, praising her beauty and appealing to her sense of duty toward a shipwrecked stranger.

Impressed by his eloquence, Nausicaa provides Odysseus with clothing and offers him guidance. She tells him to follow her wagon at a distance as they approach the city, to avoid gossip about her bringing home a strange man. She advises him to seek out her mother, Queen Arete, whose favor will be crucial for securing help to return home.

As evening approaches, Nausicaa returns to the city, and Odysseus follows later, with Athena shrouding him in mist for protection. The book ends with Odysseus pausing outside the palace, preparing to enter and face the Phaeacians.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 6 as a significant transition in Odysseus's journey from the divine realm (Calypso's island) to the human world. The Phaeacians represent what Benardete calls a "human paradise" that exists between the divine and the fully human realms.

Benardete pays particular attention to the encounter between Odysseus and Nausicaa as a philosophical exploration of the relationship between appearance and reality. Odysseus, who has just rejected immortality with Calypso, now appears in his most reduced state—naked, brine-encrusted, and utterly dependent on the mercy of others. Yet even in this state, his essential qualities of intelligence and eloquence remain intact.

The comparison Nausicaa makes between Odysseus and a god after he has bathed illustrates what Benardete sees as the "duality" inherent in human existence. Odysseus can appear godlike not because he is divine but because human excellence can mimic divinity in its outward form. This duality—being human but appearing divine—is central to Benardete's understanding of Odysseus as a philosophical figure who bridges the gap between the human and divine realms.

Benardete also notes the political dimension of this encounter. Odysseus's careful speech to Nausicaa demonstrates his political wisdom—his ability to assess a situation and adapt his approach accordingly. His decision to appeal to her as a suppliant rather than embracing her knees (the traditional gesture of supplication) shows his understanding of the delicate social dynamics at play.

The theme of marriage that runs through the book—from Athena's hint to Nausicaa about her future marriage to the possibility (never realized) of Nausicaa marrying Odysseus—represents what Benardete sees as the tension between eros and nomos (desire and law). Odysseus must navigate this tension, accepting help from the marriageable princess while maintaining his commitment to return to Penelope.

## Notable Passages

> "Stranger, you seem no wicked, foolish man—and it's Zeus himself, the Olympian, who gives out fortune to people, to each of us, good and bad, just as he pleases. He's given you this hardship, I suppose. You must bear it nonetheless."

Nausicaa's words reflect what Benardete identifies as a philosophical perspective on divine justice that differs from both Nestor's strict theodicy and the more complex view that emerges through the epic as a whole.

> "I stand in awe of you, princess—are you a goddess or a mortal? If one of those who rule the skies above, you're Artemis to the life, the daughter of mighty Zeus—I see her now—just look at your build, your bearing, your lithe flowing grace..."

Odysseus's carefully crafted speech demonstrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical significance of rhetoric—the power of persuasive speech to bridge differences and create connections between strangers.

> "But now, since you've come to our country and our city here, you'll never lack for clothing or any other gift, the right of worn-out suppliants who cross our path."

This statement about the rights of suppliants represents what Benardete identifies as the emergence of universal ethical principles that transcend particular political communities—a philosophical development that he sees as implicit in Homer's epic.
