# Book 2: Telemachus Sets Sail

## Summary

Book 2 focuses on Telemachus's first steps toward maturity and independence as he begins to take action in his father's absence. The book opens with Telemachus calling an assembly of the Ithacan elders and citizens—the first such gathering since Odysseus's departure for Troy nearly twenty years earlier.

At the assembly, Telemachus publicly denounces the suitors for their outrageous behavior, consuming his father's wealth and harassing his mother. However, the suitors, led by Antinous and Eurymachus, deflect blame onto Penelope, claiming she has led them on with false hopes. They argue that she promised to choose a husband after completing a shroud for Odysseus's father Laertes, but secretly unraveled her work each night to delay her decision.

When the assembly fails to support Telemachus against the suitors, he appeals to the gods for justice. Zeus sends two eagles that tear at each other—an omen interpreted by the elderly prophet Halitherses as foretelling Odysseus's imminent return and the suitors' doom. The suitors mock this prophecy and refuse to leave.

After the assembly, Telemachus secretly prepares for his journey to seek news of his father. Athena, now disguised as Mentor, helps him gather supplies and recruits a crew. As night falls, Telemachus sets sail for Pylos, taking his first significant step away from home and toward finding his father.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 2 as a crucial stage in examining the question of political succession and natural right. The assembly called by Telemachus represents an attempt to establish political authority in the absence of the rightful king. However, this attempt fails, revealing the weakness of political institutions without the backing of natural right and force.

Benardete notes that Telemachus's public revelation of his intentions is a political mistake that puts him at risk. When Telemachus "blurts out" Athena's "private advice" in front of the suitors, he demonstrates his political immaturity. This failure "puts his own natural right to rule into question," as natural right requires not just hereditary connection but also the wisdom to rule effectively.

The contrast between the public assembly (which fails) and the private preparations for the journey (which succeed with Athena's help) illustrates Benardete's point about the relationship between public political action and divine guidance. The assembly scene shows that in the "postheroic world" that Telemachus inhabits, traditional political methods are insufficient without the guidance of mind (represented by Athena).

The omen of the eagles represents what Benardete calls the "poetic dialectic" that brings duality and moral ambiguity into the narrative. While Halitherses interprets the omen as foretelling Odysseus's return and the suitors' doom, the suitors reject this interpretation. This conflict of interpretations raises questions about prophecy, fate, and human agency that will be explored throughout the epic.

## Notable Passages

> "Not a single word he said to the suitors, though his heart teemed with schemes."

This line highlights Telemachus's growing political awareness and the beginning of his strategic thinking, though he still lacks the full wisdom of his father.

> "You'll pay dearly, old man, for your prophecy... Go home and prophesy to your children—save them from disaster coming soon."

The suitors' dismissal of Halitherses's prophecy illustrates what Benardete identifies as the rejection of traditional religious authority in favor of immediate self-interest, a theme that connects to his discussion of the "disappearance of the gods" in a world that rejects divine guidance.

> "Father Zeus! You'll be the death of me yet... I, who never did you harm, while these suitors waste away my house."

Telemachus's appeal to Zeus reflects the tension between divine justice and human suffering that Benardete sees as central to the philosophical questions raised by the Odyssey.
