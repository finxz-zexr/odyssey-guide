# Book 9: In the One-Eyed Giant's Cave

## Summary

Book 9 marks the beginning of Odysseus's own narrative, as he finally reveals his identity to the Phaeacians and begins to recount his adventures since leaving Troy. He introduces himself as Odysseus, son of Laertes, known to all for his cunning.

Odysseus first describes his departure from Troy and his raid on the Cicones, where his men's greed cost many lives when reinforcements arrived. Next, they encounter the Lotus-Eaters, whose flowery food makes some of Odysseus's men forget their homeland. Odysseus forcibly brings these men back to the ships and they sail on.

The central episode of the book is Odysseus's encounter with the Cyclops Polyphemus, son of Poseidon. Odysseus and twelve companions enter the Cyclops's cave while he is away tending his flocks. When Polyphemus returns, he traps them inside by rolling a massive stone across the entrance. The giant discovers the men and devours two of them on the spot.

The next morning, after eating two more men, Polyphemus leaves with his flocks, again sealing the cave. Odysseus devises a plan: he and his men sharpen a wooden stake and harden it in the fire. When Polyphemus returns and eats two more men, Odysseus offers him wine. The Cyclops asks Odysseus's name, and he replies "Nobody." Once Polyphemus falls into a drunken sleep, Odysseus and his men drive the stake into his single eye, blinding him.

When other Cyclopes come to investigate Polyphemus's screams, he tells them that "Nobody" is hurting him, so they leave. The next morning, Odysseus and his surviving men escape by clinging to the undersides of Polyphemus's sheep as they exit the cave. Once safely aboard their ships, Odysseus taunts Polyphemus and reveals his true name. The enraged Cyclops prays to his father Poseidon to curse Odysseus, asking that he lose all his companions, arrive home late, and find troubles in his household.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views the Cyclops episode as central to understanding Odysseus's philosophical significance. Odysseus defeats the Cyclops by calling himself "Nobody" (Outis in Greek), a strategy that Benardete interprets as representing the power of anonymity and mind over brute force.

Benardete notes that Odysseus's use of the name "Nobody" represents a radical form of self-negation that paradoxically affirms his true nature. By becoming "Nobody," Odysseus becomes most fully himself—the man of cunning whose mind is his defining characteristic. This self-negation through naming connects to what Benardete sees as the central philosophical question of identity that runs through the Odyssey.

The Cyclops, in contrast, represents what Benardete calls a "pre-political" existence. Polyphemus lives alone, follows no laws, and acknowledges no gods. His statement that "the Cyclopes pay no mind to Zeus" represents a rejection of the divine and political order that structures the human world. In defeating the Cyclops, Odysseus affirms the superiority of human intelligence and social organization over isolated brute strength.

However, Benardete also identifies a crucial mistake in Odysseus's handling of the encounter. When safely aboard his ship, Odysseus cannot resist revealing his true name to the Cyclops, an act of pride that leads to Polyphemus's curse and Poseidon's enmity. This moment represents what Benardete sees as the tension between anonymity (which protected Odysseus) and the desire for recognition and fame (which endangers him).

The Cyclops's curse—that Odysseus should lose all his companions, arrive home late, and find troubles in his household—structures the rest of Odysseus's journey. Benardete interprets this as a philosophical reflection on the consequences of human pride and the limits of human cunning when it confronts divine power.

## Notable Passages

> "I am Odysseus, son of Laertes, known to the world for every kind of craft—my fame has reached the skies."

This self-introduction represents what Benardete sees as Odysseus's complex relationship with his own identity—he is known for his cunning, yet it is precisely by concealing his identity that he achieves his greatest success against the Cyclops.

> "Nobody—that's my name. Nobody—so my mother and father call me, all my friends."

Odysseus's false name represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical power of negation and anonymity—by becoming "Nobody," Odysseus paradoxically becomes most fully himself, the man whose mind is his defining characteristic.

> "Hear me, Poseidon, who circle the earth, dark-haired lord! If truly I am your son, and you claim to be my father, grant that Odysseus, sacker of cities, son of Laertes, who makes his home in Ithaca, may never reach that home."

The Cyclops's prayer to Poseidon represents what Benardete sees as the entry of divine vengeance into the narrative, transforming Odysseus's journey from a simple homecoming into a philosophical test of human endurance against divine opposition.
