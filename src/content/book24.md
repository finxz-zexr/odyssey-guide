# Book 24: Peace

## Summary

Book 24, the final book of the Odyssey, brings closure to the epic through three main scenes: the journey of the suitors' souls to the Underworld, Odysseus's reunion with his father Laertes, and the resolution of the conflict with the suitors' families.

The book begins with Hermes, the guide of souls, leading the ghosts of the slain suitors to the Underworld. There, they encounter the shades of Achilles and Agamemnon, who are discussing their respective fates. Agamemnon asks how so many noble young men came to die together, and Amphimedon's ghost recounts the story of Penelope's deception and Odysseus's revenge. Agamemnon contrasts Penelope's faithfulness with Clytemnestra's treachery, praising Odysseus for his good fortune in having such a virtuous wife.

Meanwhile, Odysseus journeys to the countryside to visit his elderly father, Laertes, who has been living in squalor, grieving for his son. To test his father's reactions, Odysseus initially conceals his identity, claiming to be a stranger who once hosted Odysseus. Seeing his father's profound grief at the mention of his supposedly lost son, Odysseus finally reveals himself, offering as proof his childhood knowledge of the orchard and the scar from the boar hunt. After an emotional reunion, they return to Laertes's cottage for a meal.

While they eat, news of the suitors' slaughter spreads through Ithaca. Eupithes, father of Antinous (the first suitor killed), rallies the suitors' families to seek vengeance against Odysseus. The goddess Athena consults with Zeus about how to resolve the situation, and Zeus decrees that there should be peace between Odysseus and his people, with the deaths of the suitors forgotten.

As Eupithes leads an armed mob toward Laertes's home, Odysseus, Telemachus, Laertes, and the loyal servants prepare for battle. In a surprising moment of martial glory, the elderly Laertes kills Eupithes with a well-thrown spear. Athena, appearing as Mentor, then intervenes to stop the fighting, and both sides agree to a peace settlement.

The epic ends with Athena, in the form of Mentor, establishing a covenant of peace between Odysseus and the people of Ithaca, fulfilling Zeus's decree and restoring harmony to the island kingdom.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 24 as a philosophical exploration of the theme of closure and its relationship to justice and political order. The three scenes—in the Underworld, at Laertes's farm, and the final confrontation—represent what Benardete sees as different dimensions of the restoration of order that completes the epic.

Benardete pays particular attention to the Underworld scene, interpreting it as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between individual fate and historical memory. The conversation between Agamemnon and Achilles represents what Benardete identifies as two contrasting models of heroic death—Achilles dying gloriously in battle but regretting his choice, and Agamemnon murdered ingloriously but now able to judge others' fates. This contrast illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of the reassessment of heroic values that runs throughout the Odyssey.

The reunion with Laertes represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical meditation on the relationship between political and familial restoration. Unlike the violent reclaiming of his household, Odysseus's reunion with his father involves what Benardete sees as a gentler form of recognition based on shared memory and knowledge. This difference illustrates the philosophical insight that political justice (dealing with the suitors) and familial reconciliation (reuniting with Laertes) require different approaches.

Laertes's transformation from grief-stricken old man to warrior capable of killing Eupithes represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of the rejuvenation that accompanies the restoration of proper order. This transformation illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical connection between political justice and personal vitality—when the political community is set right, individuals within it can reclaim their proper excellence.

The divine intervention that ends the cycle of vengeance represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the limits of human justice. The fact that peace must be imposed by Athena, following Zeus's decree, illustrates what Benardete sees as the philosophical insight that human conflicts sometimes require divine resolution to prevent endless cycles of retaliation. This intervention symbolizes what Benardete identifies as the theological dimension of political stability in the Homeric world.

## Notable Passages

> "Son of Laertes, resourceful Odysseus, blessed is the man who has such a wife! How virtuous was your excellent Penelope, daughter of Icarius! How faithfully she kept the memory of Odysseus, her wedded husband!"

Agamemnon's praise of Penelope represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of the relationship between female virtue and political order. This statement illustrates what Benardete identifies as the insight that the stability of the household, maintained by the faithful wife, forms the foundation for the stability of the larger political community.

> "What a day for me, dear gods! What joy—my son and grandson competing over courage!"

Laertes's exclamation when Odysseus and Telemachus prepare for battle represents what Benardete interprets as the philosophical theme of the restoration of proper generational relationships. This moment illustrates what Benardete sees as the completion of the patrilineal order that forms the basis of political legitimacy in the Homeric world.

> "Hold back, men of Ithaca, from brutal war! Break off—shed no more blood—make peace at once!"

Athena's command to end the fighting represents what Benardete identifies as the philosophical theme of the divine foundation of political peace. This intervention illustrates what Benardete sees as the insight that human justice, with its tendency toward escalating vengeance, must ultimately be constrained by a higher authority that establishes limits on retribution.

> "So the son of Cronus sealed their pacts of peace for all the years to come."

The final line of the epic represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between divine decree and human peace. This conclusion illustrates what Benardete sees as the theological dimension of political stability—the belief that lasting peace requires divine sanction rather than merely human agreement.
