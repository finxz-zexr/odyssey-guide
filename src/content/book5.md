# Book 5: Odysseus—Nymph and Shipwreck

## Summary

Book 5 marks a significant shift in the Odyssey as the narrative finally introduces Odysseus himself. The book begins with another divine assembly where Athena once again pleads with Zeus to help Odysseus return home. Zeus agrees and sends Hermes to Calypso's island, Ogygia, with orders to release Odysseus.

On the lush, isolated island, Hermes finds Calypso and delivers Zeus's command. Though reluctant and resentful that the gods deny her a mortal lover while they themselves have mortal consorts, Calypso agrees to release Odysseus. She finds him sitting on the shore, gazing out to sea and weeping for home as he has done for seven years.

Calypso informs Odysseus he is free to leave and offers to help him build a raft. She also offers him immortality if he stays, but Odysseus firmly chooses mortality and the chance to return to his home and wife. Over four days, Odysseus builds a sturdy raft, and on the fifth day, he sets sail with provisions and navigational instructions from Calypso.

For seventeen days, Odysseus sails smoothly, but on the eighteenth day, Poseidon, returning from visiting the Ethiopians, spots him and unleashes a terrible storm in vengeance for Odysseus blinding his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus. The storm destroys Odysseus's raft, but with help from the sea nymph Ino (Leucothea), who gives him her veil as a flotation device, Odysseus manages to swim for two days and nights.

Finally, Odysseus reaches the shores of Phaeacia. With Athena's help, he finds shelter in a thicket of olive trees and, exhausted, falls into a deep sleep.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 5 as pivotal for understanding Odysseus's philosophical significance. Odysseus's choice of mortality over immortality occurs during his stay with Calypso, a choice that Benardete interprets as a rejection of the "mindlessness of paradise" where "there seems to be no place for man."

Benardete suggests that this choice reflects a fundamental philosophical insight: true human existence requires the limitations and challenges of mortality. In choosing to return to Ithaca rather than accepting Calypso's offer of immortality, Odysseus affirms the value of human life with all its struggles and imperfections over a deathless but ultimately meaningless existence.

The name 'Odysseus,' which Benardete notes may be a pun on _odussamenos_ (meaning "the angry one"), points to the frustration of life, the anger of thwarted desires that cause minds to 'double' by 'talking to themselves,' or to the gods. This self-reflection, this doubling of consciousness, is precisely what makes human existence meaningful despite—or perhaps because of—its limitations.

Benardete also interprets Calypso's island as a place outside of time and history, a kind of non-place where Odysseus exists but does not truly live. His departure from Ogygia represents a re-entry into the human world of time, change, and political reality. The storm unleashed by Poseidon symbolizes the harsh realities of this world, where divine forces may be hostile and survival requires both divine aid (from Ino and Athena) and human resourcefulness.

The contrast between Calypso's offer of immortality and Ino's temporary veil (which Odysseus must return to the sea) highlights what Benardete sees as the proper relationship between mortals and immortals—mortals may receive divine aid, but they cannot become divine without losing their essential humanity.

## Notable Passages

> "But now I'll gladly sail for home, my heart longs to be home. If some god will wreck me yet again on the wine-dark sea, I can bear that too, with a spirit tempered to endure."

This declaration by Odysseus encapsulates what Benardete sees as his philosophical choice of meaningful mortality over empty immortality, and his acceptance of suffering as part of the human condition.

> "Her cave was all around with flourishing growth of vine, through which the smell of cedar and of frankincense spread far and wide. And in it there were birds long of wing... and there was a vine in its prime, with bunches of grapes, that spread around the hollow cave, and there were four springs in a row with bright water..."

The lush description of Calypso's island represents what Benardete calls the "mindlessness of paradise," a place of sensual pleasure but lacking the challenges that give meaning to human existence.

> "But when the time was come in the revolving years for his return to Ithaca, not even then was he free from toils, not even among his own people."

This passage highlights the philosophical theme of the inevitability of struggle in human life, which Benardete sees as central to Homer's vision of the human condition.
