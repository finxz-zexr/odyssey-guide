# Book 13: Ithaca at Last

## Summary

Book 13 marks a major transition in the Odyssey as Odysseus finally returns to his homeland of Ithaca. The book begins with the conclusion of Odysseus's tale to the Phaeacians, who are so moved that they shower him with even more gifts. King Alcinous orders a ship prepared for Odysseus's journey home, and after a final feast and farewell, Odysseus boards the vessel.

Odysseus falls into a deep, sweet sleep as the Phaeacian sailors expertly navigate through the night. At dawn, they reach Ithaca and gently place the still-sleeping Odysseus on shore along with all his treasures. The Phaeacians then depart, but as their ship approaches home, Poseidon—still angry about his son Polyphemus—turns it to stone and raises a mountain around their city to punish them for helping Odysseus.

When Odysseus awakens, he does not recognize his homeland due to a mist Athena has spread around him. Thinking the Phaeacians have betrayed him by leaving him in a strange land, he despairs until Athena appears, first disguised as a young shepherd. After a clever exchange where Odysseus fabricates a false identity, Athena reveals herself and praises his cunning. She then disperses the mist, allowing Odysseus to recognize Ithaca with great joy.

Athena helps Odysseus hide his treasures in a cave and then discusses his strategy for dealing with the suitors. She warns him that there are over a hundred suitors devouring his wealth and pursuing his wife, and that he must proceed with caution. She transforms Odysseus into a ragged old beggar so he can move about unrecognized and test the loyalties of those in his household.

Athena then tells Odysseus she will go to Sparta to bring Telemachus home and advises Odysseus to seek out his faithful swineherd Eumaeus. The book ends with Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, setting off inland toward Eumaeus's hut, while Athena departs for Sparta.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete views Book 13 as pivotal in the philosophical structure of the Odyssey. The return to Ithaca represents what Benardete calls a transition from the "fantastic" world of Odysseus's wanderings to the "political" world of his homeland. This transition raises fundamental philosophical questions about identity, recognition, and the nature of homecoming.

Benardete pays particular attention to Odysseus's failure to recognize Ithaca when he first awakens. This moment of non-recognition represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical problem of the relationship between place and identity. Odysseus has been absent for twenty years, and both he and Ithaca have changed. The mist Athena spreads symbolizes what Benardete identifies as the necessary obscurity that surrounds any return—one cannot simply step back into one's former life after a long absence.

The conversation between Odysseus and the disguised Athena represents what Benardete calls a "doubling" of deception that reveals a deeper truth. Odysseus lies about his identity to Athena, who is herself disguised, creating a complex interplay of truth and falsehood. Benardete interprets this exchange as illustrating the philosophical insight that sometimes deception is necessary for the eventual revelation of truth. Odysseus's false tale about being a Cretan fugitive foreshadows the actual deception he will practice in his own house.

Athena's transformation of Odysseus into a beggar represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of appearance versus reality that runs throughout the epic. By taking on the appearance of society's lowest member, Odysseus gains the freedom to observe and test others without being recognized. This transformation illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical power of anonymity—the same power Odysseus used against the Cyclops by calling himself "Nobody."

The hiding of Odysseus's treasures in the cave represents what Benardete interprets as a philosophical reflection on the relationship between wealth and identity. By separating Odysseus from the material signs of his status, Athena enables him to reclaim his household based on his inherent qualities rather than external markers of identity.

## Notable Passages

> "But now I'll shroud you in such a magic mist that no one, no man, no woman, will know you for the man you are."

Athena's disguising of Odysseus represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of concealment as a necessary prelude to true revelation. By becoming unrecognizable, Odysseus will be able to test and ultimately reclaim his true identity.

> "Always the same detachment. That's why I can't forsake you in your troubles—you are so winning, so worldly-wise, so self-possessed!"

Athena's praise for Odysseus's cunning illustrates what Benardete identifies as the philosophical ideal of metis (cunning intelligence) that characterizes Odysseus throughout the epic. This quality represents a form of wisdom that combines intellectual understanding with practical effectiveness.

> "This is my country, yes! I see it now, just as the Phaeacian king described it."

Odysseus's recognition of Ithaca represents what Benardete sees as the philosophical theme of anagnorisis (recognition) that structures the latter half of the epic. This moment of recognition is not immediate but comes only after Athena removes the mist, suggesting that true homecoming requires divine assistance and a gradual process of reorientation.
