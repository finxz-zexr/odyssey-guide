# Book 3: King Nestor Remembers

## Summary

Book 3 follows Telemachus's arrival at Pylos, the kingdom of Nestor, who was one of the Greek commanders during the Trojan War. As Telemachus and Athena (still disguised as Mentor) arrive, they find the people of Pylos performing a sacrifice to Poseidon on the shore. Nestor welcomes the visitors and invites them to join the feast.

After the rituals are completed, Telemachus introduces himself and asks Nestor for news of his father. Nestor shares his memories of the Trojan War, praising Odysseus's cunning and strategic brilliance. However, he admits that he knows little of Odysseus's fate after Troy fell, as they took different routes home. Nestor recounts how the Greek fleet was divided after the war, with some following Agamemnon and others, including himself, following Menelaus. He tells of Agamemnon's murder by Aegisthus and Clytemnestra upon his return, and how Agamemnon's son Orestes later avenged his father.

Nestor suggests that Telemachus travel to Sparta to consult with Menelaus, who returned home much later and might have news of Odysseus. When Athena (as Mentor) departs suddenly, transforming into an eagle, Nestor recognizes the divine visitation and honors Telemachus even more. He provides Telemachus with a chariot, horses, and his son Pisistratus as a companion for the journey to Sparta. The book ends with Telemachus and Pisistratus departing for Sparta the next morning.

## Philosophical Interpretation

### Benardete's Reading

In "The Bow and the Lyre," Seth Benardete identifies Nestor as a figure who represents a particular philosophical perspective on history and divine justice. Nestor believes human events to be explicable in terms of "a strict theodicy" or moral tale in which everything that happens occurs because wise and just gods cause it. In Nestor's worldview, those slaughtered are rightly slaughtered; only the good survive.

Benardete notes that Nestor's speeches lack both simile and dialogue—poetic elements that bring duality and moral ambiguity into the narrative. This absence reflects Nestor's straightforward, moralistic view of events. For Nestor, there is a clear causal relationship between human actions and divine punishment or reward.

The story of Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, and Orestes that Nestor relates serves as a parallel to Odysseus, Penelope, and Telemachus. However, Benardete suggests that this parallel is imperfect and potentially misleading. While Nestor presents Orestes as a model for Telemachus to emulate, the situations are fundamentally different. Telemachus's challenge is not to avenge a murdered father but to help restore a living father to his rightful place.

Benardete argues that Nestor's historicist account, which attempts to explain all events through divine causality, ultimately leads to the "disappearance of the gods" as they become relativized to certain places and times. The sudden revelation of Athena's divinity at the end of the book serves as a counterpoint to Nestor's perspective, suggesting that divine presence transcends historical explanation.

## Notable Passages

> "In all our days we've never seen the gods appear so openly, as Pallas Athena did to him, standing right beside him."

This recognition of Athena's divine presence challenges Nestor's historicist perspective, suggesting that the gods remain active in human affairs beyond the patterns of historical causality that Nestor describes.

> "My child, you're so like him... the same head, the same fine eyes. I'd swear it's his very voice."

Nestor's recognition of Odysseus in Telemachus speaks to the theme of natural right versus paternity. The physical and vocal resemblance suggests an inherited nature that might qualify Telemachus to rule, regardless of his political inexperience.

> "Learn from Orestes, son of Agamemnon—what glory he won throughout the world! He killed the traitor Aegisthus, who'd murdered his illustrious father."

Nestor's attempt to present Orestes as a model for Telemachus reflects what Benardete sees as the elder generation's tendency to interpret present challenges through past paradigms, potentially missing the unique nature of current circumstances.
